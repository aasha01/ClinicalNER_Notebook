Har is a 43 year old 6' 214 pound gentleman who is referred for
consultation by Dr. Harlan Oneil.  About a week ago he slipped on
the driveway at home and sustained an injury to his left ankle. 
He was seen at Tri-City Hospital and was told he had a
fracture.  He was placed in an air splint and advised to be
partial weight bearing, and he is using a cane.  He is here for
routine follow-up. 
Past medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously. 
He has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea.  He takes Prozac,
Cardizem, Glucophage and Amaryl.  He is also followed by Dr. Harold
Nutter for an arrhythmia.  He does not smoke.  He drinks
minimally.  He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures.
 
On examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle
about four fingerbreadths above the malleolus.  The malleolus is
non-tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness
either.  Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain. 
There is no significant swelling.  There are no some skin changes
with some small abrasions proximally.  There is no fibular
tenderness proximally.  No anterior pain is noted.  No hindfoot,
midfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted. 
I would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast.  He is
using a cane for ambulation.  His x-rays do not show a notable
fracture pattern today, and we will await the Radiology opinion. 
I would like him to stay in the air splint with the sock.  I will
see him back in six weeks for review at the Boxborough office. 
 
 
Diagnosis:  Left ankle fracture.

Russell, Donna

Ms. Russell comes in for further evaluation.  She has been in Rhode Island for 
six months.  Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.  She 
does not have any palpitations.  She does not note that this is 
associated with exertion.  She does have diaphoresis associated with it.  
She does not have any shortness of breath.  This heaviness has been in 
her chest on and off for the last six weeks.  She is quite concerned.

She has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.  She also has 
hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.  Her health 
maintenance has been in order.  She has just had a hysterectomy.  She 
needs to have a follow-up mammogram done.  However, today I am most 
concerned about her chest heaviness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is 
20 and pulse is 68.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  
Chest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is 
regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and 
nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of 
cyanosis, clubbing and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise 
within normal limits.  TSH is 2.0.  LFTs are pending at this time.  We 
sent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with 
nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  We also sent her for an exercise 
tolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a 
maximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 
seconds.  She had no evidence of ischemia.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.	Chest heaviness.  I am not sure what is causing this.  She may have a 
primary pulmonary problem.  She will be following up with us in one 
week.  It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal 
exercise tolerance test.
2.	Hypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time.  Continue same 
dose of Synthroid.
3.	Hypertension, well controlled presently.
4.	Hyperlipidemia.  We will recheck this on her next visit.

RE:  TUTTLE, Sandy 

MR#:  2793372 

DOB:  January 16, 2082 

 

 

Dear Dr. Duvall:  

 

Thank you for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  I understand that he is referred here for evaluation of polyneuropathy.  

 

Mr. Tuttle is a 63-year-old right-handed diabetic man who has developed numbness of his lower extremities since 2125.  The numbness started in his toes and gradually spread proximally up to the level of the knees.  In 2135, the numbness started to affect his hands.  In 2139, the patient noted atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous muscles of both hands, left worse than right.  

 

The patient denies any pain in his legs or feet.  He has a five year history of localized low back pain and neck pain radiating to his left upper extremity all the way down to his hands.  In 2125, the patient fell down a ladder from a height of about 30 feet.  According to the patient, he herniated a cervical disk, but surgery was not indicated.  He remembers having pain in his left elbow and neck after the fall.  

 

The patient developed impotence and constipation in 2130.  In 2139, he started to have symptoms of orthostatic hypotension which he described as feeling light-headed, darkening of vision upon standing.  The patient also noted gait imbalance in 2139 prior to his retirement in 2141.  

 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes since 2123, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, constipation, impotence, macular degeneration of the eyes, retinopathy, s/p laser treatments, history of neck pain and low back pain as mentioned above, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, skin problems using a number of steroid creams, penile implant in 2130.  

 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, Diltiazem, Zestril, Mevacor, steroid creams, Colace, metoclopramide, Naprosyn, insulin.   



ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  

 

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married he has two daughters, 30 and 40 years of age.  He used to work as a Legal Secretary until he retired in December of 2141.  The patient quit smoking in 2107.  He denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse.  

 

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of unclear cause at the age of 45.  His father was diabetic and had heart problems.  Mother died in her 30's.  The patient does not know the cause of death.  The patient had one brother who died in his 50's from diabetic complications.  He had two sister who died of diabetic complications.  Of his two living sisters, one of them is also a diabetic.  The patient's daughters are not diabetic.  There is no known family history of neuromuscular disorders.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Range of motion of the neck is limited.  Head turning 45 degrees to either side.  Limited neck extension.  Negative straight-leg raising.  Negative spine tenderness.  Regular cardiac rhythm, no heart murmur.  Negative carotid bruits.  In the supine position, blood pressure 105/50, heart rate 60 and regular.  Upon standing, blood pressure dropped to 60/40, heart rate remained 60.  The patient was asymptomatic.   



NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Mental status:  Alert, coherent and appropriate.  The patient knows the name of his physician, Dr. Duvall, Dr. Villagomez, and Dr. Goldberg at Pioneer Home.  

 

Cranial nerves:  Visual fields full.  Visual acuity with reading glasses 20/30 on the right, 20/20 -1 on the left.  Extraocular movements full.  No nystagmus.  Pupils sluggishly reactive to light.  Optic discs flat bilaterally.  No facial asymmetry.  The tongue and soft palate move symmetrically.  

 

Motor examination:  Atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous and ADM, worse on the left hand.  No atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis.  Negative arm drift.  Motor strength testing 5/5 in all muscles of both upper extremities except for 4/5 weakness of the first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi bilaterally.  No weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis on either hand.  Motor strength testing of the lower extremities 5/5 except for mild weakness of toe extensors 4+/5 bilaterally.  The patient was able to walk on his toes and heels while holding onto the examiner.  Deep tendon reflexes 2+ bilaterally at the biceps, triceps, and knees.  Absent ankle jerks bilaterally.  Toes downgoing.  No spasticity of the lower extremities.

   

Sensory examination:  Significant for absent pin prick sensation in both feet up to the level of the knees.  Pin prick sensation is diminished in the dorsal aspect of all fingers and the palmar aspect of both hands.  Vibratory sensation absent in the toes, intact at the ankles and knees bilaterally.  Intact vibratory sensation in the upper extremities.  Romberg test significant for body swaying, but the patient did not fall.  Tandem gait was poor, but improved when holding the examiner.  No limb ataxia.   



LABORATORY DATA:  Review of previous laboratory tests of May, 2145, BUN 36, creatinine 1.7, glucose 310.  December, 2144, TSH normal.  October, 2143, B12 normal.  Negative RPR.  The patient said he was tested negative for HIV in 2142, and 2143.  MRI of the brain in 2142 and 2143 revealed bilateral white matter changes in the cerebral hemisphere without any intracranial mass lesion.   



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, we have a 63-year-old diabetic man who appears to have significant sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic involvement.  He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.  



As we discussed on the phone, his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this.  He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.  The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.  

 

MRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.  The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125.  He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.  

 

The patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.  

 

Thank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  

 

Sincerely, 

 

 

 

Stanly Lang, M.D.

RACINE, MAINE				Name:	Quiana Justus

                                                NIHC #:	981-40-48

PROGRESS NOTE					DOB:		







Quiana is a 72-year-old woman who comes in for follow-up of her hypertension.  Please see her current medication list.  She also has a history of diabetes.  



Over the past few weeks to one month she has been having intermittent right shoulder pain.  It is worse with lifting.  The pain is in her deltoid muscle and radiates a little bit across her upper back.  It is worse if she actually lies on her shoulder at night.  There is no history of trauma, no neck pain, no upper extremity numbness or weakness except for occasional left thumb numbness.  The thumb numbness resolves if she shakes her hand.



She is also having bilateral knee pain when she walks.  There is no swelling or effusion or heat in her knees.  She had been on Vioxx for her spinal stenosis but stopped it because it was not helping her spinal stenosis pain.  Instead for her shoulder pain she has been taking Advil 200 mg 2 and up to 6 per day. She takes the Advil with food or milk and is not having any GI upset from it.  



She is having a lot of stresses with her husband, whom she feels may have some early memory problems.  His mini-mental status on his last exam was a 30/40.  However, he makes, according to her, arbitrary decisions, does not complete projects he starts, and not as task-oriented as he used to be.  He does not complete tasks or shopping errands that she would like him to do.  We discussed that he should make a follow-up appointment to see me to repeat his mini-mental status exam, but that some of these problems are not likely to be easily resolvable, and that she might benefit from finding ways to manage her anxiety and stress level.  She does get very anxious and upset at times.  She had been considering taking Ativan p.r.n. when she gets very upset and frustrated.  She is also having stressors with her grandson, who lives next door and has a problem with substance abuse and questionable money issues.  



She denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or edema.  She is on her diabetes medication.  She likes going to work because that gets her out of the house.



ON EXAMINATION:  She is a pleasant, animated woman in no acute distress.  Her blood pressure initially was 160/80.  After discussing her situation with her husband, her blood pressure was 180/85.  Neck supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear without rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm and normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  She has no peripheral edema.

 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)	Hypertension, poor control.  Will increase her Zestril to 40 mg p.o. q.d.  Her daughter, Iyanna Field who is a registered nurse, will continue to monitor her blood pressure.  

(2)	Right shoulder pain.  On exam she has good range of motion of her shoulder and her muscle strength and reflexes are intact.  She can continue the Advil p.r.n. but should take it with antacids or something to protect her stomach.  



(3)	Adult-onset diabetes.  We will check her Hemoglobin A1c.  



She will follow up for her complete physical in May.

me.  Please see the PA's note for details of the patient's past

medical, social, family history, review of systems, and physical

exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Rash on legs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 79-year-old man brought in by his

family complaining of a pruritic rash on his bilateral ankles and

today, both ankles are slightly more swollen than usual.  He has

no difficulty breathing, no chest pain.  The patient used to live

in England 4 days ago, arrived in Frankenmuth to live now

permanently with his family here.  He has a history of ""heart

problems for which he is taking Lasix, enalapril, and amlodipine

and is compliant with these medications.  He says initially his

legs were not swollen.  It was only today that the family

happened to notice as he was complaining of a rash that he had

slightly increased swelling of these ankles bilaterally.  The

patient's daughter reports that she bought him new long underwear

and noticed that the rash began where the underwear elastic band

hit his ankles in that similar distribution, there is pruritus

with evidence of excoriation.  He also does have evidence of

chronic venous stasis changes in his legs.  The leg swelling is

equal bilaterally does not extend to the calf and is minimal. 

The patient reports that he coughs when he is out in the cold

Frankenmuth air, but does not produce any sputum.  Has baseline

orthopnea and PND of 3 pillows which has not changed.  He has had

no worsening shortness of breath and no chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, TIA.  He has

no history of DVT.

afebrile.  Normal and stable vital signs, saturating 96-97% on

room air.  His exam is unremarkable except for excoriation to the

bilateral ankles with chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally

and trace 1-2+ edema bilaterally equal and the ankles only down

to the mid foot.  He has strong and equal, 2+ dorsalis pedis

pulses in the feet.  The rest of his examination is unremarkable

with clear lungs and breath sounds.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient said has no plans to

get a doctor in America.  He filled out an application

for Frankenmuth Care on arrival to the Emergency Department.  I spoke

with him and his family at length about the need to immediately

get a primary care doctor.  He was given the numbers for the

Tobey Hospital and Heritage Residence.  He has about 3 weeks of his

medications left and he is told that he will need to see ____. 

The family understands the urgency of this situation.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Today is dermatitis.  He is told to continue

his medications as prescribed to elevate the feet to decrease the

swelling.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged in satisfactory condition to follow up

with the primary care physician.

Mr. Villegas is seen today.  I have not seen him since November. 
About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because
he was gaining weight.  He does feel that his shoulders are
definitely improved.  It is unclear what he is actually taking, but
I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the
medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension
and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.  He is concerned because of the
relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the
right.  When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he
is going to pass out although this has not actually happened.  This
only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.  He has
no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other
cranial complaints.  
 
On examination today, BP 120/80.  He has no bruits over the
carotid.  He has no tenderness in this region either.  He has good
peripheral pulses at the arms.  His joint examination is much
improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint
synovitis.  
 
Clinical Impression:
 
#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to
Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.  He has stopped the
Prednisone, and I would not restart it yet.  
 
#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid
disease.  Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.  Patient
advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.  He has
been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed
that he continue to do so.  He will follow-up with me shortly after
the ultrasound study.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 46 year old male 
with complaints of chest pain and throat tightness.  The patient 
reported that he was stuck in traffic for about 12 hours last night 
and apparently got very tense.  He felt some heat from his car, 
thought that it was overheating, and then developed some chest pain 
and throat tightness.  He really described what seems to be 
fleeting chest tightness and no diaphoresis, no shortness of 
breath, and no arm numbness or tingling.  However, he did have one 
associated symptom of some throat tightness. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has had a stress test one year 
ago that was normal.  He had an echocardiogram at that time that 
was also normal. 
MEDICATIONS:  Claritin, Proventil, and cimetidine. 
ALLERGIES:  Morphine sulfate. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile. 
Vital signs are normal.  HEENT:  Normal.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS: 
Clear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm without 
murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender.  EXTREMITIES:  Negative.

change in his electrocardiogram.  Chest x-ray is clear.  CK is 155. 
Troponin is 0.13.  Electrolytes are normal.  BUN and creatinine are 
20 and 1.0.  Hematocrit is 39, white count normal. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient is a 46 year old male 
with a fleeting episode of chest pain and throat tightness while 
stuck in traffic.  He was seen at Southwest Texas Medical Center and 
then sent here appearing somewhat anxious, with a normal physical 
examination, normal EKG, normal chest x-ray, and normal metabolic 
panel.  Most likely low probability for ischemia.  Risk factors are 
also very low. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):   The patient is 
going to be admitted to the Short Stay Unit for a rule out MI 
protocol and possibly for another ETT.

Personal Data and Overall Health	

75 year old right handed man with pure motor hemiparesis synrdrome on right from L IC stroke in 6/32.



History of Present Illness	

Mr. Slater comes to the stroke clinic today for an initial visit and second opinion for left-sided weakness starting in 6/25/32. He was golfing at the time, and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes. The weakness involved the face, arm and leg on the left side only. He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220/140 (per his report). A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal. He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA. He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine. They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined. No further stroke/TIA workup was performed.



He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup. His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal. He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability. He did have ""flashing lights in both eyes"" for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course, but none since then. He has never had transient monocular blindness, diplopia, or suddenly blurry vision.



Past Medical History	

Hypertension.

He is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis. 

He has not had his cholesterol checked.



Medications	    

PROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)	 40MG PO BID Start Date: 10/1/32

HCTZ (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE)	 12.5MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32

CLONIDINE HCL	 0.2MG PO BID Start Date: 10/1/32

ZESTRIL (LISINOPRIL)	 40MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32

ASA (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID)	 81MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32



Allergies	  

NKDA	      



Social History	

lives in Avenal. Retired journalist. Widowed.

quit smoking in June, former 1 ppd x 60 years.

EtOH: couple of drinks 1-2 times per week.



Family History	

HTN in mother, aunt. 

Father died of cancer. 

No stroke



Review of Systems	

denies chest pain, SOB, palpitations.





Exam	

HEENT: NC/AT, O/P clear. Neck supple, no bruits.

Lungs: CTA bilaterally.    CV: RRR, no M/R/G. 

Abd: soft, NT/ND, + BS.    EXT: no CCE

Neuro: A, Ox3. Speech fluent, non-dysarthric. Naming, repetition intact. STM 3/3 at 5 min. Follows 3-step R/L commands. 

CN: VFFTC, EOMI without nystagmus. PERRL     

facial sensation, symmetry and strength intact. Hearing intact bilaterally. Palate moves symmetrically. SCM strength full bilaterally. Tongue midline. 

Motor: nl bulk and tone. Power 5/5 throughout. No drift.

Sensation: intact to LT, PP, temp, vib, PS throughout. 

Coord: nl FNF, HKS bilaterally. Gait normal-based, good toe, heel and tandem walk. 

DTR's: 2 throughout, toes downgoing.



Plan	

I have reviewed Mr. Slater's CT scan, and he has a lacunar infarct of the left posterior internal capsule, which explains his pure motor hemiparesis syndrome. I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension, and to use antiplatelet agents. I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 325 mg per day.



In addition, he needs a work up. I have arranged for him to have CNIS, 24 hour Holter monitoring, and TTE with bubble study. Additionally, we should check fasting lipids. 



He wishes to have a PCP at FPC, and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department, who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds. 



He will return to clinic in 2-3 months, and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was examined and 
treated in conjunction with a resident.  Briefly, the history is as 
follows:  The patient is a 47 year old male with end stage renal 
disease on hemodialysis who was referred for abdominal discomfort 
and fever.  His abdominal discomfort had begun within the preceding 
24 hours and had gradually worsened.  He had pain in the left lower 
quadrant radiating to the rectal area.  He did have one diarrheal 
bowel movement.  He specifically denied bleeding. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient was awake 
and alert, although somewhat sluggish and apparently uncomfortable. 
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure was 177/90, pulse 117, initial 
temperature 103.3, respiratory rate 20.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal. 
Sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx showed normal architecture. 
NECK:  Supple.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  LUNGS: 
The breath sounds were essentially clear.  ABDOMEN:  There was mild 
to moderate diffuse tenderness.  No definite mass can be 
appreciated.  Bowel sounds were diminished.  RECTAL:  Stool is 
guaiac-negative, per the resident's examination.  EXTREMITIES: 
Examination of the left thigh showed slight drainage at a recent 
surgical incision site. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes showed sodium 139, potassium 
4.3, chloride 99, CO2 27, BUN 12, creatinine 2.2, glucose 230. 
White blood cell count was 30,000, hematocrit 38.  Chest x-ray 
showed no definite infiltrate.  Abdominal x-ray showed dilated 
loops of small bowel.  EKG showed no change from previous tracings. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The assessment and plan were 
reviewed with the resident. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  I confirm the provisional diagnosis of abdominal 
pain with question of deep venous thrombosis versus sepsis from as 
yet unidentified source.

Re:  Umstead, Kenneth
     MR #401-10-87-8
 
Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology office today
and he seems to be doing very well from a cardiovascular
perspective.  Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has
undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps. 
Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed.  This has been
reevaluated and he has been stable.  The fourth polyp will need to
be removed at a later time.  At this point, his aspirin has been
discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also
discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests. 
His current medications therefore include Lasix 40 mg per day,
Metoprolol 25 mg qd, Nifedipine XL 30 mg qd.  He is aware of a
belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no
exertional or other related symptoms.  He is reasonably active but
somewhat limited by his claudication.
 
On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 130/70,
a heart rate of 65 and regular.  Head and neck were unremarkable. 
Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension
at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a
physiologic split.  There is an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was
unremarkable.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  
 
His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus
rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left
intraventricular conduction delay.
 
Jacob Bautista, M.D.
Re:  Umstead, Kenneth

I think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well.  It would be of
value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since
2069.  He had minimal ischemia at that time.  There are no symptoms
that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will
see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings. 
 
 
If any problems develop, please don't hesitate to contact me. 
Thank you very much for allowing me to help with his care.
 
Kindest personal regards.
 
Sincerely yours,

Referring Physician:  Dr. Kenyon, Dr. Elmer Ure, Vallejo General 
Cardiology.  
 
Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant. Rule out 
osteoporosis.  
 
HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.  At 
the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.  
Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
approximately 26 weeks.  At that point, he was believed to be in 
remission and stayed in remission since then.  
 
In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.  Subsequently he 
was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.  
He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.  The patient's 
complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.  There is 
no peripheral neuropathy.  There is no autonomic neuropathy.  No retinal 
disease.  However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
creatinine currently of 2.4.  
 
Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
symptoms in the early 80s.  By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 
2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial 
infarctions.  In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.  Since 
that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
degree of symptoms.  
 
The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.  Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. 
twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 
mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.  
 
Review of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that 
was from a trauma some years ago.  Other past medical history includes 
history of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.

Family History:  His sister, aged 54, and mother, have osteoporosis with 
his mother having fairly severe osteoporosis with a normal of vertebral 
collapses and some nerve damage.  His father and mother have had 
diabetes mellitus, his father dying of heart disease.  There is a 
19-year-old daughter who has a history of migraines.  There is no 
history of thyroid disease in the family.
 
Social History:  He currently works at Belkin and has a desk job 
there.  He quit smoking and drinking 15-20 years ago.  He has been 
married for over 20 years.  His review of symptoms revealed the absence 
of GI symptoms.  There were no orthostatic symptoms, no angina.  Normal 
sexual function.  He denied any skin problems or rashes.  He denied 
numbness and tingling in his feet, etc.  There is a history of 
hypertension.  
 
Other review of systems:  His height has been stable at 6'2"" tall.  
 
Physical Examination:  Blood pressure 130/93.  Heart rate 96.   The 
patient is a well-appearing gentleman, somewhat obese.  His height is 
6'2"".  Weight 294 lbs. which is apparently steadily been increasing.  He 
has a mild Cushingoid appearance with a little bit of posterior cervical 
and supraclavicular fat.  Retina appeared without lesions.  Normal 
extra-ocular movements.  His oral mucosa was moist without evidence of 
thrush.  Neck exam:  He had a supple neck with no carotid bruits.  
Normal thyroid.   His chest exam revealed clear lung fields with normal 
excretion.  There was no bony tenderness or abnormalities on his back.  
His cardiac exam:  He had a soft, S1, S2.  Cardiac exam otherwise 
unremarkable.  His abdomen was soft.  He had some evidence of insulin 
injections, but no significant hypertrophy.  He injects both in his 
abdomen and rotates with his arms.  His extremities revealed minimal 
stasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric.  No edema.  
Neurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic.  He had normal to slightly 
decreased vibratory sensation in his big toes.  
 
Laboratory Exam:  Most recent laboratories that I could find were 
February 09, 2084.  Sodium 141.  K 5.1; chloride 105.  Bicarb 20.  BUN 
39.  Creatinine 3.4; glucose 136.  His CK was 219.  Calcium 9.7.  
Albumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0.  Alkaline phosphatase was 90.  Uric acid 
5.1; magnesium 1.9.  TSH was 1.6.  Cholesterol 242.  Triglycerides 226.  
His cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273.  His CBC 
revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a 
normal differential.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of 
multiple medical problems.  The one's most pertinent to us currently are

the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
osteoporosis.  The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.  
The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
patients.  However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
this makes sense.  We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
reasons.  We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.  We would be a little 
reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
without more information about this patient.  The patient's diabetes 
seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.  Given the fact that it sounds like 
he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
situation.  Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

RE:Fair, Bill

MR#:220-41-86-4

 

Dear Dr. Keys:

 

Dr. Oates and I saw Bill Fair today with regard to his troublesome 

right knee.  As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.  He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, 

mainly related to sports injuries.

 

He has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.  It got so 

bad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that. 

 

It has slowly got better since then.  

 

At present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with 

activity but he also has rest and night pain.  He has a restricted walking 

distance.

 

With regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and 

requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.  He has 

noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.  

 

With regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of 

Tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to 

have a colonoscopy in the near future.  

 

He has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.

 

On examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than 

the left.  He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.  

 

He has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of 

arthritis.  He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 

degrees.  His varus deformity is not fully correctable.  He has grade 5 

quadriceps power.  

 

X-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete 

obliteration of joint space on the right side.  

 

I note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment 

arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.  

 

We have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial 

osteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement. 

 

At present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe 

enough to warrant operative intervention.  We would certainly reconsider 

should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, 

instilling some corticosteroids.  We have advised him that this will only 

provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin 

some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.

 

We have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will 

reassess him.  Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly 

ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the 

knee and instill some corticosteroid.  

 

With kind regards.  

 

Yours sincerely,

Chief Complaint: 

Shortness of breath



History of The Present Illness:  

	Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath. He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis. He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication. His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper. 

He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.  On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.  This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted. The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths. He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day. This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.

Radiology

	CXR 9/06/62: IMPRESSION: MILD INCREASE IN LINEAR OPACITIES LIKELY SECONDARY TO INTERSTITIAL EDEMA.



Cardiogram

EKG 9/06/62 04:41- 87 BPM, NSR, non-specific T wave abnormalities consisting of inverted T 

waves in aVL (unchanged from previous EKG 12/30/60), no evidence of ischemic changes



Assessment/Plan:

	In summary, Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of insulin-requiring DM, hypertension, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal. His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.  His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.



Problem List and Plan:

SOB/Chest tightness:

	--continue to cycle enzymes for R/O

-CXR AP and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema

	-TTE

	-diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV

	-Hydralazine 10mg QID & Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID 

	-d/c Lisinopril

-continue O2 at 2L, monitor O2 sat

	-monitor ins and outs, daily weights

	-obtain lipid panel to assess CAD risk factors and need for statin

Renal failure: acute over chronic, baseline nephropathy due to DM and HTN, history of 

+protein in urine, urine sediment spun, no signs of active sediment 

-urinary electrolytes to measure FENa

-d/c Lisinopril

-dose Neurontin according to renal function

-consider ruling out renal artery stenosis

-obtain urinary eosinophils to evaluate for interstitial nephritis

Hypertension: hypertensive emergency considered, but determined to be unlikely due to 

chronity of elevated SBP at similar values, under treatment

Record date: 2072-10-28

She's doing much better from her painful R facial weakness (? Ramsay Hunt syndrome).  She di dnot take tegretol, but rather increased her amytriptiline and added some darvocet acutely, now off these meds.  Her R eye ""tears a lot"", at no particular time (ie, not necessarily when she's masticating), and occasionally it burns....but she has not developed conjunctivitis or ocular redness or discharge.  She has difficulty chewing opn the R side of her mouth, and finds she""pockets"" food in her R cheek; she manages by chewing on L, and swallowing frequently, especially taking extra liquids.

The pain has receded-  she now only gets ""a twinge"" now and then.



Husband has noticed she's not hearing quite as well.



Her current meds include amitryptiline 25 hs, mevacor 20, procardia 30 bid, furosemide 40x3, isosorbide 20 qd allopurinol 300 qd.  She's releived to learn the results of her recent blood work, including BUN 65 Creat 3.4, Hct 29.8



On exam, she has gained weight since I last saw her; she comes in ok0on wheelchair, but is able to take a few steps with her straight cane, and climb onto the examining tabloe with only contact guard. Dense catarcts; fundi not visualized; EOMS full without ptosis or nystagmus. Cornelas are brisk pilaterally, but she has decreased sensationon the R lower facial segments (V1, V2); excellent masseter and temporalis strength. R lower facial weakness, with less evident weakness of orbicularis oculi; he manages to close the eyelid almost completely; + Bell's phenomenon.  She hears finger rub at 90 cm on R, 70 cm on L; Weber lateralizes to the R, but Rinne' positive bilatyerally (ie, AC>BC AU). Tongue midline.  Modulates voice well.  TMs opaque, but EACs clear.



She has a marked polyneuropathy, with decreased vibration from knuckles to elbows bilaterally Hyporeflexia throughout, but symmetrical.  Strength remains well conserved.



IMP: improving R Bell's. MRI showed much motion, but no gross abnormalities



Plan- continue with current management. I'd welcome the oportunity of seeing her again in about 6 months.

RE:  Vivian Lea Jorgenson

     MR#471-90-84-7

 

Dear Dr. Geiger:

 

Thank you for referring your patient, Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a

preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September 17, 2071. 

As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease. 

She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and

brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has

increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and

she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September

of this year.  In terms of her cardiac history, she was well

until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath

and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart

failure.  At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which

revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to

shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a

dilated left ventricle.  In addition, she had an echo in June of

2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral

regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. 

She has never been hospitalized since that time for her

congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good

result. She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or

claudication.  She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.

In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her

recollection.  She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house

and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs. She is

able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty

from chest 

 

Jorgenson, Vivian Lea

MR #471-90-84-7               -2-            August 21, 2071

 

pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops

secondary to fatigue.  

 

Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule. She has never had

surgery. Her family history is significant for a mother who died

of myocardial infarction at the age of 55. 

 

Her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for

40 years and quit four years ago. She denies alcohol, intravenous

drugs or cocaine use.  She lives with her husband and briefly

worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.  She

has no known drug allergies. 

 

Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril

50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po

QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily

and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.  

 

On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in

her left arm and 165/70 in her right. Her heart rate was 104 when

I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today. Her JVP was 7

centimeters. Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid

bruits. Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles. Her

heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with

occasional ectopic beats. She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6

systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without

radiation. Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds. Her

extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.  

 

Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.  She has a

diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin

effects.  She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old

anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.  

 

In summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease

with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,

likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial

infarction, although she has never undergone heart

catheterization.  She is currently undergoing evaluation for a

thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule. 

 

Jorgenson, Vivian Lea

MR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071

 

Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 

given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden

since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with

imaging. If this is similar to her previous study showing only

fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she

will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative

myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is

well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having

surgery.  

 

Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection

fraction.  She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection

fraction. As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation

and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or

rhythm.  Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days

prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after

surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons

as to how may days she should wait after surgery before

restarting that medication.  She will otherwise remain on her

current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and

primary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.  If her stress test

is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for

further evaluation.  

 

Thank you for referring this interesting patient. She was seen

and examined with Dr. Voss. 

 

Sincerely,

RE:		Jarvis, Amador

PCC#:		090-73-07



January 20, 2088



Reason for visit:  Mr. Jarvis comes to follow up on his hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal insufficiency and elevated PSA.  



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has seen Dr. Jose Quirk and a prostate biopsy has been recommended.  This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it.  



He began the Captopril and HCTZ (? or Maxide) and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH.  At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved.  He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself.  His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 140 to 150 range fasting.  On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170.  



He has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this. 



He has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month.  



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today he looks well and comfortable.  His blood pressure is 140/76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68.  His weight is 173 (stable).  



IMPRESSION:  Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program.  Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program.  



We will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today.  He will return in four months for follow up.  





Orvell Oliver, M.D. 

Labs:  Hemolyzed sample shows K of 6.0.  Will check re HCTZ vs Maxide.  If the latter, will change it.

70-year-old female, first visit to MSH AMED. 



MEDICATIONS:  Ibuprofen 800 mg 1 p.o. b.i.d., has taken for years. Self-d/c'd meclizine, unclear status on H2 blocker.



ALLERGIES: Percocet, codeine, sulfa.



PMH: Includes fibromyalgia with chronic pain, osteoarthritis, recurrent vertigo, cervical spondylosis, lumbar spondylosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, myofascial pain, dizziness, syncope, chest pain of unclear etiology, sinusitis, DJD. Status post laminectomy 2062. 



S:	70-year-old female accompanied by daughter, Qazi, here to initiate primary care closer to home. Previously followed by Dr. Faust, but daughter needs closer PCP. In addition, patient followed in arthritis clinic by Dr. Solomon and has received injections per patient report from severe muscle spasms of both arms. Also seen by pain clinic. Main issue is continued lower back pain and primary care. Of concern is patient reveals an unclear history of chest pain which was thought to be arthritis, but is accompanied by episodes of syncope, witnessed in a grocery store. Patient has not had to her knowledge a cardiac workup for this. Also had some vascular studies done at that time and was told they were normal. The patient is unclear on status of recent pelvic exam. GYN - G7, P7, still with uterus but not sexually active. Denies any change in bowels. Denies any change in appetite. 



The patient has been complaining of animals crawling across her chest. States she used a cream for 1 week with resolution but now feels the animals are back, and she has been using a pesticide agent which sounds like a Kwell agent to resolve these. 



Recent testing - L-spine films confirm grade 2 anterospondylolisthesis L4-L5 with disc space changes at L1-L2. Negative allergy testing. 1/1 immune globulin testing significant for an IgG of 15/40 and positive ANA at 1:40 and 1:60. MRI of spine 12/93 shows degenerative changes of lumbar spine. No evidence of disc herniation or canal stenosis. 11/92 - Paranasal sinus films show no evidence of sinusitis. Mammo 3/94 WNL. Carotid ultrasound done 12/93 shows minimal disease of right and left carotid bifurcations. TCDs 12/93 suggest a stenosis of the left vertebral artery with an RVA WNL. Velocity suggests a mild stenosis. EKG 12/93 shows sinus brad with an LAE. No other significant changes. Nonspecific ST changes. 



O:	HEENT - Unremarkable. Skin - No obvious sign of rash or infection where she states the animals are present. CV - BP is 170/88. RR at 60. No murmurs, gallops, rubs present. Lungs - Clear to P&A. B12 was 331. Attempted Pap smear. External genitalia unremarkable. Vaginal introitus is very small. Patient got very cold and clammy and nervous throughout the tried Pap smear; so Pap smear attempt was terminated at that time. Consent was obtained to conduct Pap smear. Lungs - Clear to P&A. 



A/P:	(1)	Dizziness of unclear etiology. Neuro consult had been done when the patient was hospitalized, and meclizine has not been of any benefit. Will refer patient to Vascular to ascertain whether the TCD findings are related. 



(2)	Report of syncope. Will obtain stress test.



(3)	Chronic NSAID usage. Add ranitidine HCL 150 mg to 1 p.o. q.h.s. to regime. Patient will follow up with Dr. Helen Whitehead as  her new PCP.

	Interval History:
   Roger Easterling, M.D. 
27 Caroll St, #734 
Bluefield, ME 12111 

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service on 10/28/2078. He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis. He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning. 

His episodes of chest pain are interesting. He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching. The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset. They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge. He is otherwise in fairly good health.


	Past medical history:
   1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis 
2) Palpitations 
3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071

	

	Allergies:
	
No known drug allergy


	Medications (Confirmed):

	
aspirin  81 mg po daily
penicillin VK  500 mg po 4 x day


	Family history:
   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. 


	Social history:
   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine.

Habits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.


	Review of systems:
   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.

Physical examination:
	
-BP: 110/70  
-Pulse: 59  BPM regular
-resp. rate: 16  unlabored
-Skin:   without lesions or nodules.
-HEENT:   EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Mucous membranes moist.  No oropharyngeal lesions.
-Neck:   carotids 2+ without bruits; jugular venous pressure &lt;5 cm of water; thyroid without nodules; trachea midline.
-Chest:   lungs clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion, and symmetric in expansion.
-Cardiac:   regular with a normal S1/S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
-Abdomen:   soft, nontender, without organomegaly or other masses.
-Extremities:   no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
-Neuro:   reflexes were 1+; cranial nerves 2-12 were intact; motor and sensory modalities were intact in all four extremities.


	EKG:
   10/28/2078: Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.


	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort. Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se. It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past. 

We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed. 

I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress. 

Yours truly, 

Norman C. Ivers, M.D.

RE:  Francis, Lydia
PAH#:     981-82-02

SUBJECTIVE: Lydia has been doing well since her right total
hip arthroplasty in January of 2089.  She still has pain in
the right hip and the left hip, which is likely due to
osteoarthritis.  She has been taking Percocet for pain
control.  Fortunately, she is not having problems with
constipation, as she is taking a stool softener.  She is
taking calcitonin and Evista for her osteoporosis.  In
addition, she has had a history of right tibial
osteomyelitis and is taking prophylactic Levaquin, without
evidence of GI upset or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  She
is taking Cozaar for her blood pressure control, and is also
taking Neurontin for pain control.  At home, she is wearing
a firm brace that Dr. Younce has prescribed.  In addition,
she is using a walker for ambulation when outside the house
and a cane when inside the house.  She comes today for her
appointment with her son.  She arrived in a wheelchair.

On examination, her blood pressure today is 138/80 with a
pulse of 80 and a respiratory rate of 16.  She is afebrile.
Cardiac exam is a regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without
murmurs.  Her neck is supple, although she does have
paracervical pain to palpation.  Her lungs are clear to
auscultation.  She has pain throughout the paraspinal
muscles in the thoracic and lumbosacral area.  She has some
pain with flexion at the hip, with limited motion at both
hips.  She has no evidence of lower extremity erythema or
edema.  Her peripheral pulses are intact.  Her patellar
reflexes are absent.  She has good pedal pulses.  She denies
depression and overall is encouraged.  She plans a trip to
Peru soon.

Medications are updated in LMR.

DISPOSITION: She will follow up with me for a complete
physical examination in November of this year, and she will
be fasting at that time.

Re:	Horn, Gregory

	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23



Dear Dr. Givens:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, in follow-up regarding possible interstitial lung disease. 



He has managed to lose 3 lbs. on his own personal diet plan, and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control.



His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm, grading it as 2 out of 10 vs. 8-9 out of 10, to which his wife agrees.  They both attribute it to the Prilosec.



He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.  He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.



Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.



No lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.



Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.



On examination, he is well appearing.  Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored. Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff. Conjunctivae are clear.  Oropharynx is clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy. Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.  Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.  JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.



Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.



My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.  



Impression:



1.	Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.  Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.  There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.  He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.



2.	GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.  If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.



3.	Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.



4.	Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.



5.	Chronic cough.



6.	Diabetes - Better controlled.



7.	Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.  As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.



Recommendations:



1.	Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d. dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.



2.	Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.



3.	Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.



Sincerely, 





Paul N. Tam, M.D.

NAME:    Vines, Stephen

MRN:     1672569



Mr. Vines comes in today.  He has been feeling pretty well though he is

distressed at his 18-pound weight gain.  His sugars were in the 300s before starting

the insulin.  Since he started the insulin, his sugars have come down nicely.  His

fasting sugars have been in the 120s.  His afternoon sugars have been in the 70-90s. 

He had a few hypoglycemic episodes early on but has not had some in almost a

month.  Other than that, he really has no new complaints.  He is still not smoking. 

He is still on the patch.  His neuropathy has not gotten any worse and he thinks he

can stop the Neurontin now.  He has not had any shortness of breath, cough or

edema.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.  No GI symptoms, no GU symptoms and no

new skin symptoms, no arthritic complaints. 



HABITS: Not smoking or drinking.  Not getting much exercise now.



PHYSICAL EXAM: His blood pressure is 140/80 on the left, 150/80 on the right. 

His pulse is 76 and regular.  Respirations are 16.  Lungs are clear. Heart: Regular

rate and rhythm, negative M/R/G.  No bruits heard.  Nasopharynx unremarkable. 

Abdomen is benign.  He has diminished pulses but good capillary refill in the feet. 

The cellulitis on the left ankle is completely resolved.  He has some neuropathy of

the feet with decreased sense to vibration in both feet, but his sensation to

monofilament is intact on both feet. 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c today.  It may still be a little bit

     high as he has undergone a rather brisk change since starting his insulin.  I

     encouraged him to check his sugars a couple times a week, especially in the

     afternoon.  If he continues to get low sugars, will cut back on his morning

     insulin to 35 units.  He is going to bring in a form for custom shoes given his

     neuropathy and is followed closely by Podiatry.  He had an eye exam earlier

     this year with Dr. Yousif.



(2)  Hypertension.  Will increase his Mavik to 4 mg a day.



(3)  Hyperlipidemia.  Recheck lipids and SGOT today.



(4)  CAD prevention.  He can't take aspirin so we will start Plavix 75 mg a day.



(5)  Status-post splenectomy.  He needs a Pneumovax booster 0.5 cc was given in

     the left deltoid.

HPI:  Patient is a 59-year old who has a history or active issues 
significant for hypertension first diagnosed on visit of 10-74.  She is 
currently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d., nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO 
q.d., and potassium chloride 10 ml. equivalents PO q.d.  Patient comes in 
today for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine 
baseline examinations.  On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160/90, 
and on check today it was 150/90.  We discussed the possibility that she 
continue her salt-restricted diet.  We also discussed that she continue 
her own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed 
the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.  She currently 
weighs 199 lbs. and stands approximately 4'9"" tall.  
 
As far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood 
pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that 
time if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine 
XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly 
gain some better control or possibly adding another agent.  However, at 
this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure 
and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood 
pressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the 
200s-190s.
 
 
Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation 
now appears to be much more stable.  She is currently living with her 
mother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good 
about her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no 
murmurs.  Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal 
tenderness.  She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace 
swelling bilaterally at the ankles.   Breast exam: no evidence of masses 
or lumps.
 
She will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a 
mammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool 
guaiacs.  Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent 
issue at this point.

New Patient Visit







Chief Complaint of:  2nd opinion



History of Present Illness: 74 yo M who comes to the office in search of a second opinion about his care at the Boaz Nursing Home in Lynden. He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH. Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT. Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him. He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.





Impression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH. I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future. I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA. He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.

Problems	  

breast carcinoma	      

S:  The pt. is five years S/P modified radical mastectomy, with 3 of 14 nodes involved, with a poorly differentiated intra-ductal carcinoma.  She's been on Tamoxifen 10 mg. b.i.d. since that time and is being followed by Dr. Quy Cherry.  For the past several years she has been on 20 mg. of Tamoxifen b.i.d.

O:  Well-healed L modified radical mastectomy.  No axillary notes noted.  R breast appears normal.  Pt. gets routine mammograms on the R breast.

A:  S/P left radical mastectomy for ca. of the breast, with no evidence of recurrence.

P:  No further therapy indicated.

Osteoarthritis	      

S:  Pt. takes Indocin intermittently for pain in her hips and hands.  She has a long history of osteoarthritis.

O:  Minimal degenerative joint disease, changes in hands and legs, with some distortion of the knees.

A:  Mild OA.

P:  Indocin was renewed.

Hypertensive heart disease	      

S:  Pt. has been treated for hypertension since 2064.  When she came to me in 2084 she'd been on Accupril 5 mg. a day, but her BP was 180/80.  Since that time, despite the administration of a variety of antihypertensives, her BP has rarely been normal and she insists that her BP is a function of having come to the doctor.

O:  BP 180/80.  Heart is NSR, without murmurs, gallops, clicks or ectopy.  EKG shows no LVH.  Fundi show some narrowing of the arterioles.

A:  White coat hypertension?

P:  Pt. told that we felt it was important to lower her BP.  She is on Accupril 20 mg. and Atican 32 mg. daily.  She finally accepted our medication to double her medication to Atican 64 and Accupril 40 mg. daily.  We will check her BP in three weeks.

1. OBESITY - he feels his weight is down a little.  He has been trying to eat

mainly meat and vegetables, but he is ""stupid"" sometimes and cheats.



2. HYPERTENSION - in good range.  He has been making an effort to avoid Na.



3. PROTEINURIA  - he has been off Naprosyn for about 6 weeks, has appt scheduled with Dr. Fry 6/05.  Will plan to repeat 24 hr urine for protein towards the end of next week.  His pedal edema has improved considerably, so possibly his albumin is better.



4. DJD - Ultam is helpful, but not as good as Naprosyn.  Knees and ankles are stiff and painful, especially if he is active and then sits still for a while.

This patient was seen with Dr. Nabor Jacoby.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and 
obesity.  Her problems are as follows:
 
1.   Diabetes.  She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose 
     and she was put on insulin by me.  Xitlali Xia followed her in 
     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as 
     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.  
     She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any 
     list of her blood sugars.  She says she does take them about twice a 
     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and 
     threw them away.  She says that they never go higher than 200; that 
     they usually are about 110.  It was 101 this morning before 
     breakfast, she says.  She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
     six times it has been below 50.  She does say she eats three regular 
     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
     breakfast she said no.  She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
 
     I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.  I expressed to her again how 
     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.  
     She had been eating a lot of chocolate.  She says she has gotten off 
     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
     then.  She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
     help her with her diet.  If her diet does get better, maybe we can 
     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.  I explained to her, too, 
     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
     be able to get her off the insulin.  This seemed to be something that 
     she would like to do.  Hopefully the nutritionist can help.  I also 
     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, 
     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
     really going on and whether they are getting too low.  She denies any 
     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.  I am 
     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.  
     She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no 
     nothing.  She felt totally normal.  So hopefully she will really 
     record these and we will get a better idea.  She said this always 
     happens in the morning.  She kept contradicting herself and had no 
     documentation.  I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
     Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.  She does drink juice, 
     but I went over the symptoms again with her.  She will call me if she 
     does have any.
                                              10-19-86
 
 
 
2.   Left ankle pain.  I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.  
     She said that she may do some surgery on her.
 
3.   Dysuria.  She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
     Bactrim.
 
4.   Yeast infection.  She said this has also resolved.
 
5.   She complains of headache.  She says these have been going on for two 
     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.  
     She has had nausea and vomited once.  This happened pretty much every 
     day and it can be at any time of the day.  Tylenol and Advil did not 
     help.  She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.  
     But she has no further prodrome.  She says it is a banging kind of 
     pain that is rhythmic.  She also says she does see stars in front of 
     her eyes when it happens.  I asked her if she had any hearing loss, 
     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
     sometimes.  It has been happening for a couple of weeks.  I discussed 
     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like 
     migraines.  I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.  Her neuro exam 
     was totally normal.  Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.  
     Her gait was normal.  Light touch was touched.  Her toes were 
     downgoing.  Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.  Her disks were 
     sharp.  EOMI, PERRL.  I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO 
     t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
     her left ear.  I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
 
6.   Health maintenance.  I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
     that she might benefit from a flu shot.  She has no interest in this 
     at all.  Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh 
     cuff.  Her pulse was 96.  Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 
     285.

                     CARDIOLOGY OFFICE NOTE
 
NOTE
     Ms. Uher returns after a 4  year hiatus.  She is now 52 and
has long-standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h/o retinopathy
OS, possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy.  She
had a maximal negative exercise test in 2059 and has felt generally
well since that time.  Over the past year she has not been as
careful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her
sugars regularly.  A random cholesterol w/i the past year was over
300.
     She has intermittently had sharp, brief discomforts of the
anterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea,
diaphoresis or light-headedness.  There has not been any reduction
in her physical capacity, in fact, she feels stronger than a year
ago and is working full-time.  There has been no orthopnea, PND or
peripheral edema.  She is interested in increasing her physical
activity program.
     Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age
20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father
developed coronary disease possibly in his 50's.  She is
perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her
gynecologist Dr. Bradley Brandt.
     Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day.
 
EXAM
     She is comfortable at rest.  BP 110/76, HR 80 and reg.  No
JVD.  Carotids full w/o bruits.  Chest clr.  Cardiac exam shows
normal heart sounds w/o gallop or murmur.  Abd. soft w/o
organomegaly.  No peripheral edema.
     Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis
and is a normal tracing.
     For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help
gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed
using the standard bruce protocol.  She exercised for 9 minutes, 8
seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of
chest pain or inordinate dyspnea.  Peak heart rate was 143 (85%
maximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure. 
There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work
load.  Compared to the test of 9/15/59 she exercised 1 minute, 4
seconds longer.
 
IMPRESSION
     1.  No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time. 
She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, family h/o coronary disease and a
perimenopausal state.  She will be seeing Dr. David Yun as
her primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid
profile be obtained and that dietary/pharmacologic therapy be 
PAGE 2
UHER,OLGA

instituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130.  From a cardiac
standpoint, post-menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired.  Low
dose aspirin therapy could also be considered.
     I would be happy to see Ms. Uher for additional cardiac
evaluation as needed in the future.

Vernon, ME 27525



RE:  		Jaquante Xuereb

SRI: 		134-43-51



Dear Dr. You:



Thank you for asking me to consult in the care of this complex patient.  Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot.  He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle.  He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070.  After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity.  He denies any history of trauma.  He is a former smoker.  He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease.  He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.



Past surgical history is as above.



Medications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d., aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.



No known drug allergies.



Review of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension.  All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.



Habits, he is a former tobacco smoker.  He denies alcohol use.



Family history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.



On physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort.  Respiratory rate is 12-14.  Pulse is 60-70 and regular.  Weight is 172 pounds.  Blood pressure is 170/90 in the right arm, 150/90 in the left.  No jugular venous distention.  Normal respiratory effort.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur or bruit.  He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally.  Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic.  On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals.  He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity.  No varicosities.  He does have dependent rubor, cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes.  The right great toe is blanched.  He has no abdominal masses, tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.  He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis, ulcers or sores.  He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with slightly depressed affect.



Assessment and Plan:  



1. Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft.  We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours.  We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow  with either thrombolysis and/or angioplasty and stenting.  If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.

2. Tobacco abuse:  The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.

3. Hypertension:  Moderately controlled on current medications.  His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.  We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.  

4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram.  I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.  



Thank you for allowing me to participate in his management.  If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.  



Sincerely,







Shane R. Herring, M.D.

Identification:  Patient is a 53-year old markedly obese female 
complaining of bilateral weight knee pain.  She denies any morning 
stiffness, any jelling phenomena.  She has had no trauma or effusions in 
the knee.  She had noted on x-ray many years ago that she had had a 
chipped bone in the right knee and some mild osteoarthritis but it has 
bothered her only intermittently until this year.  Last year she did go 
to Briggs Stratton and dropped to 270 lb. at which point her knees felt 
better, but currently she is back up to over 300 lb. and at her height 
of 5 ft. 1 in., she is in pain.  She has not visited a physician.  She 
has no internist who currently checks on her general medical health, but 
she does report that the occasional Advil she takes does produce some 
dyspepsia.  She has no history of gout, no history of psoriasis, no 
history of pseudogout or any rash, alopecia, headaches, shoulder or hip 
discomfort.  She does not complain of back pain but does have difficult 
walking 50 yards because of the knee pain.
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Medications:  Occasional Advil.
 
Past Surgical History:  Cholecystectomy 2064.  Two c-sections.
 
Past Medical History:  Negative for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, 
stroke, tuberculosis, hepatitis, asthma, heart disease.
 
Family History:  Mother is alive and well with no medical problems.  
Father is alive and well with no medical problems.  She has 12 siblings.  
One sibling died of pneumonia at a young age.  Another sibling has 
asthma.
 
Physical Examination;  She is a markedly obese female, no apparent 
distress.  She is 5 ft. 1 in. and weighs 304 lb.  Examination of joints:  
No evidence of active synovitis or pain in her DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, 
elbows, shoulders.  Bilateral hips are limited in internal external 
rotation but not because of pain-- due to obesity, bilateral knees have 
crepitus, but no warmth or swelling.  There is some pain at extremes of 
flexion on the left of 110 degrees.  Ankles and toes within normal 
limits.  Please note above in the clinical history that she does not 
complain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because 
of the knee pain.  The blood pressure could not be taken secondary to 
the fact that the large blood pressure 
cuff did not fit around her right arm. 
 
Impression:  
 
1.   Probable bilateral osteoarthritis.  I will obtain plain films and 
     have prescribed Disalcid 3 gm. a day p.r.n.   GI and renal side 
     effects explained.
                                              2-03-68
 
 
 
2.   We discussed seriously the need for weight loss.  She will be 
     referred to the nutritionist to get on a weight loss program.  She 
     will seriously entertain a weight loss program.  Patient will 
     return in a few months unless she has any further problems.
 
3.   I have referred her to an Internal Medicine doctor for health maintenance since 
     she does not have one as yet.

RE:  Gerald, Marion 

MRN: 48967301 

DOV: 05/18/83



Dear Dr. Olive,



Thanks for asking me to see Marion Gerald who I saw on May 18.  She is 

referred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.  The patient states she is 

currently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she 

developed diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.  This continued to bother her 

and she eventually was treated with steroids.  I am not sure she had a 

diagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.  She then was switched to ibuprofen which 

did not work particularly well.  Over this time, she would have intermittent 

episodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in 

her palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.  She was seen by 

Dr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states 

she had ""25 shots"" of steroids.  She denies any hot or swollen joints.  She 

has had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.  Extensive ROS reveals 

no photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's.  She 

has urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly 

well.  She has continued to be concerned about that.  She has had fevers or 

chills but no temperature elevation.  She has intermittent abdominal pain but 

has had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.  She has 

morning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.



Family history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.  Mother is 

85.  Two sons alive and well.  Two siblings alive and well except for 

hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.



Past medical history is pertinent for above.  She has had a partial 

hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist.  Medications 

include for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following: 

metformin 500 b.i.d., verapamil 240 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg 

q.d., Bumex 20 q.d., cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d., and Allegra.  

No smoking or drinking history.  No allergies.  No other medical problems.



Social history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown.  She works as a 

midwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic.  Her husband is 

a Broadcast Technician.  They have traveled quite a bit because of this.

MRN: 48967301 

Page 2





Physical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress.  Weight 152.  BP 

120/80.  She had a respiratory rate of 16.  She had full range of motion of 

all of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles, greater trochanters, and 

cervical and lumbar area.  Otherwise, no active synovitis or skin lesions.  

No oral ulcerations.  Good salivary pool.  No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, 

or axillary adenopathy.  Chest: clear to A&P.  No carotid bruits.  Vascular 

exam: normal.  Cardiac exam: quiet precordium without murmur or gallop.  

Abdominal exam: nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities: without 

edema.



I suspect she has fibromyalgia.  I do not really know the place of steroids 

in this setting.  I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK, LFTs, TSH, 

CBC, ESR, as well as a urine, ANA, CRP, and RF.  I will see her back in four 

to six weeks.  She will get old records for me to review.  We will talk about 

what therapeutic interventions we may take at that time, but I really need to 

have more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign.  

I will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in.



Sincerely yours,

                             OFFICE NOTE
 
Address:  26 Burrit St, Marlborough, WI 21145
 
First visit for this 51-year-old white male.
 
1.  Gout.  This has been present for 7 years.  Evaluated at Mary by
Dr. Farrar.  Treated with Colchicine.  He cut down the amount of
organ meats and red meat that he had been eating at the time.  He has
not had any alcohol for 11 years.  Strong family history in his father
and all his brothers.  Continues to have 4 or 5 relatively mild flares
a year which are frequently attributable to forgetting to take the
Colchicine.
 
PMH:  Tonsillectomy.  Cervical radiculitis.  He is a recovering
alcoholic.  No alcohol for 11 years.  Hypertension when he was
drinking.  Hidradenitis.  
 
Meds:  Colchicine 0.6 mg q.d.  
 
ALL:  None.
 
FH:  Father died at 57 from an MI.  Mother at 60 in her sleep. 
Brothers have gout, one has hypertension.
 
SH:  Married for the second time.  His wife is Emily Ippolito another
patient of mine.  They will have been married for one year in May. 
He works as a Patternmaker for McCall in Enid.  He averages 1 1/2
packs of cigarettes a day for the last 35 years.  No alcohol.  No drugs
or HIV exposure.
 
ROS:  Bifocals. Slightly decreased hearing in the left ear.  No chest
pain.  Has a chronic AM cough bringing up 1/4 cup of phlegm daily.  He
occasionally plays tennis and bicycles.  He believes his cholesterol
was 170.  Does like high cholesterol food but has cut back because his
wife has a problem.  He uses seat belts.
 
On physical examination he is a very pleasant large white male.  His
weight is 222 lbs., blood pressure 128/88, heart rate 72.  HEENT -
EOMI, PERL, fundi negative.  Cerumen impacted against the TM's.  Benign
oral cavity examination.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Lungs
clear.  No murmurs or gallops.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No testicular
masses or hernias.  Normal prostate, guaiac negative stool.   Absent
distal pulses.  2+ femoral pulses without any bruits.  1+ reflexes.  No
swelling or tenderness over the first MTP's.  Neurologic exam shows
hearing decreased to watch tick bilaterally.  Air conduction is greater
than bone.  Weber is not lateralized.  
 
Impressions and plans:  1.  Gout.  It sounds like this is really not
much of a problem when he remembers to take the Colchicine.  I
encouraged him to make this a regular habit.  We will check a random
uric acid level.
 
2.  Cardiac risk factors.  He is a male with a very positive family
history who is a smoker.  He has significant cardiac risk factors.  We
spent a long time talking about smoking today.  At his request I gave
him a prescription for Nicoderm patches.  He will start at 21 mg for
six weeks and then move to 14 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mg for 2 weeks.  We
will check a cholesterol and he should be less than 200 given his risk
factors.  I pointed out to him his evidence by history of chronic
bronchitis and of peripheral vascular disease.  I think he found this
sobering.
 
3.  General health.  We discussed exercise, cholesterol and seat belts.
We also discussed the use of Q-Tips which I think may also be a
significant contributing factor to his decreased hearing and the
impaction of cerumen.  I recommended ear drops.  We can have him tested
formally when he becomes interested in intervention.

This patient wants to transfer his care from the McCook Erie Clinic to me. He 
got 
my name from a nurse who works in the hospital.  HE is a 58 year old white 
male retired Transportation Manager with a number of issues.  
1)  He had a cyst or a mass enlarge in his R submental region which was 
excised 
at the McCook Erie Clinic.  Note from his surgeon there said the path showed 
nonkaziating granuloma.  I hope cultures are pending.  The patient does 
volunteer at a homeless shelter so could  certainly be exposed to TB or 
atypical mycobacteria.  
2)  The patient has know mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation followed 
at the MEC by a cardiologist. He had a stress test in the last year that was 
benign. Never had CHF or endocarditis.  
3)  Social situation.  The patient is a sober alcoholic and sober for the 
last 
2 years however he went through divorce probably because of his alcoholism 
10 years ago and took early retirement from Brookdale Metro Systems because 
of his alcoholism. He stays sober by going to meetings and also 
volunteering at the McCook Clinic. He lives with a woman. He has good 
relations with his grown children and his grand children.  His woman friend 
is very supportive and the patient is now feeling good enough about himself 
that he is ready to try and get work full time.  Previous attempts to do so 
have resulted in failure because of his Hx of alcoholism and his premature 
retirement.
 
Family Hx. Father died at age 79 of Altzheimers and some kind of cancer ? 
throat cancer.  His mother had diabetes and coronary artery disease and she 
died of colon cancer. The patient himself had a colonoscopy within the last 
year and it was normal.  One brother and 2 sisters, one of the sisters also 
has mitral valve disease. 
 
Past medical Hx the alcoholism and he was stabbed in the L hand I think in 
2059 and that was repaired. He also had a TNA in childhood. 
 
He has no known allergies to medications.
 
The only medication he takes is Lisinopril 5 mg for blood pressure. He was 
only started on this in the last year. He also takes a vitamin a day.
 
His other significant medical complaint is erectile dysfunction.  He has 
normal libido and good sexual drive however he tends to lose erection after 
he 
has gone for a few minutes.  He can achieve vaginal penetration.  His live in 
lover has been supportive but she would like him to have better performance 
and so would he. He does wake up in the morning frequently with erections. He 
has no known Hx of diabetes.  No prolonged hypertension or vascular disease.  
 
Social Hx.  The patient eats fairly well. He walks usually a mile or so a 
day.  
He does not do any aerobic activity. He does smoke  to a pack a day and has 
for many, many years.  He does wear seat belts when he drives and does not do 
any elicit drugs.  On system review:  Weight stable.  No change in skin. He 
always had a very gravelly voice.  He has had no change in his vision. He is 
very deaf in the L ear.  He has a morning cough no hemoptysis.  Cough is 
about 
a teaspoon of white/gray sputum. He has no dyspnea on exertion.  He has no 
angina.  No palpitations.  No presyncope or syncope.  NO claudication. He has 
no dysphagia. He has no epigastric discomfort.  No change in his bowel 
movements and no rectal bleeding.  He has no claudication.  No edema and no 
joint pains. No headaches and no low back pain.  No long bone pain.  He has 
no 
heat or cold intolerance.  He has no easy bruisability.  
 
PE: shows him to 5'7"".  155 lbs.  Skin benign.  Nails do show some early 
clubbing. No cyanosis.  Normal no AV knicking.  Flat disks. Pupils equally 
round and reactive to light and accommodation at 3 mm. Nares normal.  TMs 
normal. Hearing is markedly diminished in the L ear. Head is normal cephalic. 
Thyroid not enlarged.  There is the scar at the site of his excision under 
the 
mandible. No associated adenopathy on either R or L neck or axilla or the 
supraclavicular region.  He is hyperesonant to percussion.  He has distant 
breath sounds. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes. He has normal S1.  Normal S2 and 
holosystolic blowing 2-3/6 mid systolic murmur radiates best to the axilla. 
No 
radiation to the clavicles. No carotid bruits.  Jugular venous pulsation to 7 
sonometers. Abdomen is soft and non tender. There is no enlargement of the 
liver. No adeventitious masses. There is a L inguinal weakness without frank 
hernia.  Phallus uncircumsized. Testes normal. Prostate is a little difficult 
feel because he has a band around the anal sphincter which makes it difficult 
for me to get beyond but I felt probably half of his prostate and it was 
normal and smooth. Stool was guac negative. Reflexes 3+ and equal throughout 
and normal vibratory sense and touch. Normal gait and station.
 
Assessment and Plan:
 
1)  Recent rapidly growing mass under the R mandible showing nonkaziating 
granuloma.  Culture is pending and we will plant a PPD and control early 
next week. I will have him tracked down the report of this from the MEC and 
get culture reports and will get chest x-ray today both for his COPD to 
rule out a cavitary lesion.  
2)  Alcoholism now sober.
3)  Erectile dysfunction try Viagra. He was given appropriate warnings and 
instructions.  I gave him 100 mg # 7.  
4)  Mitral valve prolapse by auscultation followed by cardiologist at the MEC.
5)  We spent a long time talking about smoking cessation.  He has some 
Wellbutrin at home from when he was depressed while getting sober and I 
encouraged him to take 150 b.i.d. and we made a plan for him to try and 
quit.   I will see patient again next week to plant a PPD and then see him 
again in about a month to see how he is doing.  We will certainly check the 
chest x-ray to make sure he did not have active cavitary disease.

Patient Name: LAGNSTON, SHERMAN I.;  MRN: 7223692
Dictated at: 12/09/67 by GARY J. HUGHES, MD 

 
FOLLOW UP NOTE 
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Renal cell carcinoma, presumably metastatic to T1.  Interval since conformal radiation therapy to vertebra T1 to a dose of 50.4 gray:  Three months.  
 
TUMOR STATUS:  Not available.  
 
NORMAL TISSUE STATUS:  No difficulty.  
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Lagnston is generally doing well with no deterioration and some improvement in his symptomatology.  He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so.  He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight.  He has no weakness in any extremities.  His nocturia has decreased from three to one.  His hands feel a little ""fuzzy.""  The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he looks well.  His weight is up to 230 pounds.  He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout.  His abdomen is entirely negative, so is his incision.  
 
IMPRESSION:  Clinically possibly slightly improved, certainly no evidence of progression.  
 
PLAN:  I will obtain a repeat chest and thoracic spine CT, as well as a bone scan.  Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months.  Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are.  Dr. Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure.

RE:  Peggy Tinsley
     MR #236-67-03-3
 
Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.  This patient
with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated
on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.  She has been doing well
except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for
the past week.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest
pain.  She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.  Her blood
sugars at home have been between 120 and 180.  
 
Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,
Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin
NPH 10 units qam.
 
On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial
dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.  CBC at the time
revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.  Blood
cultures were sent.
 
On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60
and a pulse of 88.  She was afebrile.  Head and neck examination
was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.  On cardiovascular
examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no
peripheral edema.  Heart sounds were normal.
 
Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+
protein and 2+ glucose.
 
Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center. 
There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection. 
She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary
tract infection.  Because of her early satiety she has been
eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a
gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.

RE:  Roberta Vincent
     MR #380-18-32-2
 
Dear Dr. Long:
 
Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.  I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,
2092.  Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
 
Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal
failure of unknown etiology.  She is six years status post
hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult
leiomyosarcoma was discovered.  She has an extensive history of
hidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension.  She had one stillborn
infant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions. 
SFOC records are unavailable at this time.
 
Her medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,
furosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,
Niferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex
250 mg qid.
 
On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no
distress.  Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs.  Temperature
is normal.  Pulse is 88 beats per minute.  Blood pressure is
178/96.  There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.  There is a
buffalo hump.  The lungs show scattered wheezing.  Cardiovascular
exam is normal.  There are discolorations of the skin across the
neck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not
raised.  The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.  There is a
ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.  The
extremities show trace edema.  There are several areas of
superficial petechiae.
 
In summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of
unclear etiology.  She does report an episode of lower extremity
swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.  ThisRoberta Vincent
MR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092
 
 
raises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now
in a chronic phase.  Other diagnostic possibilities include other
forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus
erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions. 
Nevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this
time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased
risk due to her body habitus.
 
I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.
Vincent. Although she has no medical conditions which would
preclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her
obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of
hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.  I have
encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in
order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or
transplantation.  Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent
of Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not
been performed previously.
 
I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her
kidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to
meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV
fistula or placement of a graft.
 
Thank you once again for your kind referral.
 
Respectfully,

TRIBAL INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Hart, Matthew
                                              1-29-62
 
 
 
History of Present Illness: This was the first Internal Medicine clinic visit for 
this 38-year-old black male with a history of non-insulin dependent 
diabetes diagnosed a year ago, maintained on Diabeta 5 mg. q.d.  Also 
with a history of borderline hypertension previously on 
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d. for the last year, which he discontinued 
last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks 
he has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and 
he is afraid that his sugar is up.  He states that over the last two or 
three weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light 
followed by mild headaches.  He says that the visual changes are usually 
accompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with 
Excedrin in 5 minutes to an hour.  He does admit to a history of 
migraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more 
severe than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous 
migraine aura.  
 
He states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time 
they did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come 
to this appointment at this time.  He denies any fevers.  He does have a 
recent 25 lb weight gain and he admits to new nocturia of 2-3 times a 
night over the last three weeks.  He also has been complaining of 
diarrhea two or three times a week over the last two to three weeks, 
which is watery in nature without any blood.  He has no nausea or 
vomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like 
this in the past.  His past medical history is otherwise benign.  
 
Habits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free 
basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest 
pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart 
from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less 
frequently.  He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.  
He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.  He is sexually 
active with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors.
 
Family History:  His family history is notable for a grandmother with 
diabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with 
history of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here.  
His oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is 
alive and well without any medical problems. 
 
Physical Examination;  He is a mildly obese black male in no acute 
distress with weight of 270 lbs.  Blood pressure 138/88 in the right arm 
and 132/94 in the left arm.  Pulse regular at about 80.  HEENT was 
notable for normal fundi without any evidence of diabetic retinopathy or 
hypertensive retinopathy.  Oropharynx was clear.  He had no thyromegaly.  
His chest was clear.  His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his 
                                              1-29-62
 
 
 
heart sounds were normal.  His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, 
without any hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally 
descended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace 
heme positive stool.  Neurologic exam was intact. 
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased 
     sugar at this time.  Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow 
     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta 
     to 10 mg. q.d.  He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet 
     control as well.  
2.   Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.  I 
     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it 
     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt 
     diet.  
3.   Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.  I will get a 
     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to 
     three weeks, and follow it at this time.
4.   Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this 
     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result 
     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this 
     time.

ED Attending Physician Note

HPI

See NP note for full details. Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week. The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain. He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder. No fevers/chills. Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets.

ROS

otherwise neg

Vitals

See Nursing Notes

PE

See NP note for full exam.

Neurologic exam: A & O x3, CN 2-12 intact, motor 5/5 all ext, sensation intact to light touch throughout, nl gait, normal finger-to-nose bilaterally, neg pronator drift. Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.

Medical Decision Making ED Course

75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED. The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance. Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well. Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications). Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week. Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

Condition on Discharge

Stable

Diagnoses

Back pain

Review Comments

I have personally seen and examined the patient and confirmed the resident's examination, reviewed and agree with the resident's documentation of history, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care and disposition of the patient with the resident.

Dear Dr. Nunes:
 
Thank you for asking me to see Mr. Craft. Patient says he was diagnosed 
as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker 
Xian and was treated with steroids at the time. It's not clear what CNS 
or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time. Because of complex 
partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who 
referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his 
estradiol level was in the 80s. His testosterone was up but available 
testosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he 
said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures. Said he was doing 
fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred. He 
said his neck felt full and warm. His head felt like it was going to 
explode. He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was 
vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't 
right. Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and 
postnasal drip. Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and 
anti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any 
other results). He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis 
on his legs. No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth 
or gum except that he has to wear his glasses. Recently had some teeth 
removed. Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough. No other 
cardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension. No GI 
problems. Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to 
benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR. Dr. Nunes

A PSA has been normal. Past history of kidney stones. He's allergic to 
penicillin, Lozol, allopurinol and bee venom. Has a past history of 
diagnosis of gout versus pseudogout. Sleeps fine. No history of fractures. 
Only operation is a total knee replacement on the left for arthritis and 
appendectomy. Bruises easily, frequently has headaches. Has been diagnosed 
as being bipolar. Exercises.
 
Recent MRI consistent with a ""vasculopathy.""
 
Family history. Mother died of colon cancer at 62, smoked. Father died 
at 62 of heart attack, stroke and insulin dependent diabetes, also 
smoked. He is an only child.
 
Social history. Doesn't smoke. When he's depressed he becomes a binge 
drinker. Exercises when he's not depressed. He's retired since 2103. Was 
a stage manager.
 
Physical exam. Somewhat overweight gentleman. Blood pressure was 160/80. 
Pulse was 88 and regular. Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on 
forearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees. One 
small node in the left side of his neck. Mouth and throat was clear. 
Bilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left. Ear drums fine. 
Hearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the 
forehead). Chest clear. No CVA tenderness. Heart: No murmurs. Abdomen, 
no organs, masses, tenderness but obese. Extremity, joint exam fine. 
Neurological fine.
 
I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current 
symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection. 
However, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to 
also exclude lupus and vasculitis. Basically I told him to take Flonase 
twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip 
cleared up. 
 
In the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a 
stabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the 
testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of 
testosterone, the Clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease 
estradiol, Levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, Altace 10 mg twice a day regarding 
hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain. Patient 
also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments 
regarding increased appetite, decreased memory,

decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased 
hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of 
cholinergic transmission problems.
 
Also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking 
Aricept to improve his memory. Took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it 
for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted. 
 
Thank you again for asking me to see him. Please let me know if I can be 
of further assistance. 
 
Sincerely yours,

PS: If you could give me some information of what evidence there was 
that he had systemic lupus and neuropsychiatric lupus back in 2103 at 
the Vermilion Hospital, for instance the discharge summary from the Vermilion Hospital, that would be appreciated.

PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
 
 
 
History of Present Illness:  The patient returns one week after being 
seen here initially in Internal Medicine clinic.  On the last visit he was having 
chest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further 
evaluation.  At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any 
ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.  
The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in 
the past with a decreased LV function.  However repeat echo within the 
past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process 
of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the 
Humbert Hospital against medical advice.  After being evaluated in the 
Emergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with 
the Internal Medicine clinic.  
 
Medications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include 
Carafate 1 gm. PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO 
q.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d. p.r.n. and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.  His 
insulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m. and 18 units q.p.m. 
and regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.  
 
On return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest 
pain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since 
discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.
 
Physical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate 
of 76.  He is not in any acute distress.  His chest is clear to 
auscultation.  His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart 
sounds.  His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.  His 
rectal exam is guaiac negative.  His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ 
pitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Cardiac.  The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study 
     to rule out ischemia.
 
2.   Hypertension.  His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.
 
3.   Diabetes.  His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick 
     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.
 
4.   The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of 
     his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes.
 
5.   General.  The patient will see me shortly after completion of an 
     ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.

Re:	Jarome DEJESUS

	ECI 280-44-07-1



Dear Dr. Ponce:



I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Dejesus during his ECI admission 05/16-07/14.  He is a 72-year-old man with CAD S/P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC, found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA.  Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia, he was brought to ECI, where Dr. Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3.5mm by 32mm Taxus drug-eluting stent, with zero percent residual.  The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal, and there were no complications.  



He spent an uneventful evening without complaints, ambulating without difficulty.  His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit, and extremities were warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9, hematocrit 37, platelets 236,000, and flat cardiac enzymes.  He was discharged home on Plavix, 75mg po qd for a minimum of six months; enteric-coated aspirin, 325mg po qd; digoxin, 0.25mg po qd; glyburide, 5mg po bid; metoprolol, 50mg po bid; Lipitor, 20mg po qd; Tikosyn, 500mcg po bid; Glucophage, to be resumed at 500mg po bid in two days; and Coumadin, to be resumed tonight.  He has PT/INR check arranged in several days.  He will follow up with you in the next two weeks, and will see his PMD, Dr. Paige, in the near future.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.  Please call if you have questions.



Sincerely,







Barbara A. Rhoades, MD

Record date: 2088-06-28

Reason for Visit	

Comprehensive physical exam and ongoing management of multiple medical problems.



Problems	  

Congestive heart failure	      

He had admission to MCH 9/87 with CHF.  He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit.  He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms.  Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well.  Most recent echo from 5/02/88 showed severely depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%, global hypokinesis with antero-apical akinesis.  Moderate LV margin.  Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement (41 mm.).  Dilated aortic loop.  Normal RV size and function.  Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR.



He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB, orthopnea or pedal edema.  He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.

coronary artery disease	      

After his admission for CHF, he underwent dolbutamine stress test on 9/30/87, which revealed a small area of ischemia in mid-anterior and a moderate to large-sized area of ischemia inferiorly and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress.  Based on this, he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization.  10/87 he underwent stenting X4 of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch.  Notably, his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD, which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery.  The L main had no significant lesions.  The LAD had a 50% lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid-LAD was occluded.



He had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [        ] therapy.  He was discharged the following day without complications.  Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD (see below), he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina.

pacemaker	      

S/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome 7/83 and doing well.  Continues follow-up with Dr. Whitlock/Cook.

S/P CARDIAC ARREST	      

12/76.  10/76 DEVELOPED EXERTIONAL ANGINA, POSITIVE ETT. CATH AT NEDH REVEALED THREE-VESSEL CAD. AWAITING CABG WHEN 12/76 SUFFERED CARDIAC ARREST. FOUND TO BE IN VT, HAD RECURRENT VT. TRANSFERRED TO MCH AND UNDERWENT CABG AND AICD 2/77.  [04-Nov-2078]



He is doing well S/P ICD implantation in 2/77 with revisions in 7/80 and in 2084.  

hypertension	      

BP is slightly high today, but we will recheck at next visit.  If it remains elevated, would consider increasing Carvedilol

diabetes mellitus	      

He continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently, they are typically in the 120's and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.  He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process.  Will check FBS, HBA1C and urine for microalbumin today.

hypercholesterolemia	      

He has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor.  We will check fasting lipids and LFT's today.

nephropathy	      

S/P renal biopsy 10/79 for severe proteinuria which was consistent with diabetic nephropathy. As noted above, a 24-hour urine recently revealed 6gm of protein.  He is on new maximal doses of ACEI's.  [02-Jun-2087]



Recheck BUN and creatinine today.

peripheral vascular disease	      

He has bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses, but because of his limited walking ability, currently has no symptoms of claudication.

RECTAL FISTULA	      

SINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. JENSON AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE. SIG. HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA. HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED.  PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS, BUT WILL LET DR. JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS.  CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS.

OSTEOARTHRITIS	      

He has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain.  It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk, so that he can only ""limp less than a block"" and has difficulty with stairs.  Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring, he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible.  Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.

Carotid stenosis	      

According to Dr. Cook's records, a carotid artery duplex scan from 5/06 showed 60 to 80% stenosis of the RICA, but I do not find those records of PCIS.  Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. Cook.  He is S/P R cerebellar CVA back in '80 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms.



Review of Systems	

Small lesion on his R ear.  Recent R groin infection which required treatment with antiobiotics by Dr. Valentine in 5/06.  Nocturia X1.  Denies symptoms of hypoglycemia.  No neurologic symptoms.  Denies palpitations, SOB, chest pain, lightheadedness or syncope.  Denies peripheral edema.  No abdominal pain or change in his bowels.  He does have chronic rectal fistula and continues to have intermittent hematochezia and discharge, but he is able to self-treat this and declines surgery.  No melena.

MAMARONECK INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Orta, Phil
                                              55931516
                                              8-02-73
 
                                              
                                              
HPI:  Mr. Orta is a 50-year-old African-American man who has been 
treated for the five past years by LBH at Edgefield.  He was seen in MHC 
clinic prior to that.  His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone 
number is 872-9985.  Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact 
that he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has 
not seen a physician in the past year.
 
His medical problems include:
1.   Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063.  It is unclear 
     which vessels were plastied.  
2.   Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin 
     for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia.  However, he has not taken any 
     niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well. 
3.   Anxiety.
4.   Condyloma last fall.
 
Medications:  1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO 
q.h.s. prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH.  Patient also had 
nitroglycerin tablets at home.  Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO 
t.i.d.; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance.  
He does not have any history of hypertension in the past.
 
Social history:  He is currently not working.  He has been unemployed for 
a month and a half.  He used to be a social worker which did not 
involve any heavy lifting.  He did community services managment.  He 
lives with his mother and his sister and has never been married.  
 
Review of systems:  Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of 
chest pains over the last 10 years.  However, he does say that his last 
chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.  When asked where the 
pain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the 
pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his 
angioplasty.  He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was 
relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.  At the 
time he was just sitting on his couch watching television.  He has no 
history of exertional angina over the last several years.  However, this 
complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.  He 
currently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on 
exertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope.
 
On physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no 
apparent distress.  Temperature was afebrile.  Heart rate was 68 and 
regular.  Blood pressure was 126/92 in the right arm in a sitting 
position.  HEENT was within normal limits.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  
Heart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Abdomen was benign.  Extremities were without edema or lesions.

Assessment and Plan:
 
1.   Cardiovascular.  Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given 
     his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest 
     pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.  Given that he is on 
     no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to 
     initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d. in an attempt to 
     control his blood pressure and heart rate.  I also encouraged him to 
     continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of 
     nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.  
     The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and 
     maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.  After he 
     has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an 
     outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any 
     evidence of ischemia at this time.  If he does, we will recommend a 
     cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be 
     causing syms of rest angina.  The case was discussed with any 
     cardiacs that are on call.
 
2.   Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an 
     SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does 
     have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also 
     has at a level of 336.  He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in 
     the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year.  I 
     instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his 
     diet and explained which food contain those products.  I will also 
     initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease 
     both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.  We will start him 
     off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d. later this week.
 
3.   Daily anxiety.  Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to 
     control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without 
     Ativan.
 
4.   History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.  Patient 
     states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on 
     his next visit.  If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for 
     liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.

5.   Patient is now applying for free care at Mamaroneck Health Center 
     status post losing his job and LBH insurance last year.  The 
     patient's home phone number is 534-3442.

RE:  Parrish, Christopher 
SFC#:  553-15-48 
 
Dear Dr. Kirk:  
 
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today.  He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria.  The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.  An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.  The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.  The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.  Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.  There was no critical carotid stenosis.  He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale.  He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.  His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.  It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.  He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.  He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.   


Since his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.  He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.  He has no symptoms of aphasia.  He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.  I would agree with him.  He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.  Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.  He has not had any problems with spasms.   


His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.  He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.  He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.  His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.  He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.  He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.  He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.  
 
His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o. q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o. q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.  He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.  He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.  I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.  He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.  
 
The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.  The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.  There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke.  
 
On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.  His blood pressure was 150/90.  His language was intact.  His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.  He was alert and oriented.  His conversation was appropriate.  The visual fields were full.  The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.  Facial sensation was normal.  There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.  The tongue and palate were midline.  The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.  There was atrophy of the left biceps.  There was full range of motion of the joints.  The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors.  The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.  His right side was 5/5.  He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.  His right toe was downgoing.  Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.  I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.  Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.  He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.  
 
Mr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.  He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.  I hope that this will be the case.  Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.  I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.  His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.  I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent.  I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.  The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.  I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.  However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.  He should continue on an aspirin a day.  He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.  I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.  We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.   This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.  After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.  I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.  I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.  
 
The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.  
 
Sincerely,

CCU JAR Admission Note



Name: Urban, Russell

MRN:  4722064

Date of Admission:  7/09/93

PCP:   Georgia

Cards: ward



ID:  50 y/o man transferred to CCU for wide complex tachyarrhythmia 



HPI:  50 y/o man with no PMH and cardiac risk factors of smoking and family history (father died of MI at age 41) who presented to the ED with chest pain. He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia 4 years ago.  He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least 3 miles without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly.   At concert on day of admission, he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain, 8/10, no radiation, associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis.  Pt reported some associated back pain with onset, like ""I was being crushed like a sandwich.""  Was not eating at time, not like heartburn, no fevers, chills, cough, or chest trauma.  EMT was called-2 SL ntg relieved pain, was given ASA. 



On arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free.  His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.  On hindsight, EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III,    mm aVF, 1mm STD in I, ? aVL with biphasic T in I, TWI in aVL.  He received ASA and SLTNG

Cardiac RF include tobacco (1/2 ppd x 30 yrs) and early family hx (Dad died of MI, first MI at 41).  No known HTN, DM, or hyperlipidemia.  



Course on floor:



Seen for initial H&P when patient came to CCU5.  During exam, patient became acutely diaphoretic, appeared uncomfortable, still complaining of CP with some mild back pain.  

BP:  L arm 105/66, R arm 90/63. (2 rpt BPs were equal on both arms within 5 mm Hg) HR bradycardia in high 40s, sat 98% 2L.  Tele demonstrated sinus brady, then several runs of 40-50bt wide QRS tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia. Pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely SOB, diaphoretic.  Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged, 12 ld EKG repeated, pt was given 2 mg IV magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine, started on nonbreather. Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU.  



On arrival to CCU, pt was lethargic and diaphoretic.  He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea.



SDU Course:

For ventricular ectopy (likely AIVR in setting of ischemia), pt was transitioned to Amiodarone.  This was tapered off and he had no further ectopy.

 

Echo was performed 7/10:

                                  (normal)     (completed only if abn.)

MITRAL VALVE

There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  There is trace mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.



LEFT ATRIUM

There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis.  The aortic valve is

tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral

Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function is impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic with

regional variation. The Inferior wall is akinetic.  The estimated ejection

fraction is 28 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricle is diffusely

hypokinetic.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.



Pt was taken to the cath lab 7/11 where his RHC showed RA 9, PA 25/15/20, PCWP 13, CO 6.4.  Mild LAD disease, 30% circumflex stenosis, RCA 100% occlusion, stented x3 with dissection of RCA during procedure.  He also had transient reocclusion during procedure.  TIMI II flow after IC adenosine.  IABP and temp wire (for profound bradycardia) were placed during procedure.  V-gram showed basal inferior AK and anterolateral HK, EF approximately 40%.  His peak CK were 1491.

Because his initial echo showed low EF out of proportion to his ischemic event, other causes of low EF were investigated.  His serum Fe was slightly low, TSH was normal, SPEP had several low Igs but no evidence of myeloma.   Lipid profile showed Cholesterol 210, Trig 59, HDL 45, LDL 153.  HgbA1c was 6.3.  Because of reocclusion during cath, hypercoag workup was sent and was negative (including lupus anticoagulant, hypercoag panel, HIT).

He continued to have some chest pain post-cath with mild increase of CK likely d/t distal embolization.  He has now been persistently pain-free.  His IABP was d/ced 7/12.  He was continued on ASA, Plavix, Lipitor and Bblocker, Captopril were added and can be titrated up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 


Mr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago.  He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.  While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as ""sharp burning pressure"".  He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes. There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.  An EKG was ""normal"" and he was discharged on NG. Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized. On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have ""diffuse CAD"" involving several vessels. Stent placement was not attempted. His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward. A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: 


ASA 81 mg
Plavix 75 mg po qd
Bisoprolol 5mg po qd
Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm
Ranitidine 300 mg po qd
Lipitor 40 mg po qd
A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs
Metformin 1000 mg po bid


Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital. He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes. It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:


Testing performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.  Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.  No chest pain was    reported.  Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.    The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.  See exercise report for full ECG details.        Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.      There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.  Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%. No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.       Trace mitral regurgitation.4.  Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.      All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.
  
Mr. Austin has  Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in January.  At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina.   


Glycemic control ahs been variable.  Last HGBA1C in 11/85 was 7.8.  Lately there has been an increase in fating levels.  Today BG 162. Last week 112 at home. He is no longer exercising.  Has nocturia X2 but without dysuria. Denies polyuria, polydipsia, nause, chills and fever. Appetite normal. 


 He has residual right shoulder pain after a fall in Dec 2094 which was significantly improved by  steroid injections. Episode of bilateral low-pitched  ringing in his ears has abated. Uses two pillows. No PND, orthopnea and leg edema. Denies vision changes. .  Denies episodes of light-headedness or vertigo.  


PMHx:
H/O diabetes mellitus type 2 : h/o poorly controlled diabetes, which improved and then deteriorated. 

Cataracts. He was seen by Ophthalmology and was told insurance does not cover cataract surgery which he needs. 
 


Vital Signs

Re:  William Potts
     MR#  109-16-75-8
 
Dear Matt:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Potts in follow up today.  As you
know, he recently had a complicated hospital course.  He underwent
cardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD
including 70% and 90% stenoses.  The first marginal branch had a
60% ostial stenosis.  The right coronary artery had 60 and 80%
stenoses, respectively.  The PDA had a 70% narrowing.  Given his
very significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided to
proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as
the obtuse marginal.  It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel,
and not worth going after at this time.  The RCA was successfully
stented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left
ventricular branch.  By the end of the procedure, flow had been
restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch,
but Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial
infarction.  Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular
branch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated.  
 
Mr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure. The second
exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging.  He exercised for
nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol, and experienced chest
pain.  He had a maximal blood pressure of 148/72 and a heart rate
of 121.  MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial
infarction of the basal 1/3 of the inferior wall.  There was
moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the
territory of the RCA.
 
Given these findings, it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts
undergo bypass surgery.  
 
Mr. Potts was discharged on aspirin, Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d.,
Atorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s., Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., Imdur 60 mg q.d. 
He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin.
 
Of note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress
recently.  His 89-year-old mother has been at Whitehead recovering
William Potts
MR#  109-16-75-8              -2-       January 5, 2070
 
from a hip fracture.  He is having difficulty arranging the
appropriate insurance to cover her medications. 
 
Mr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.  This
occurs with increased activity, and is relief with either rest
and/or 1 nitroglycerin.  He has decreased his work level
considerably, and is relatively sedentary.
 
On physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress.  He had
a blood pressure of 112/70, with a heart rate of 60.  His weight
was 203 pounds.  Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. 
Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced PMI
with a normal S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. 
Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.   His abdomen is soft,
nontender.  There is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux. 
Extremities are without edema.
 
Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61. 
Intervals are .16/.08/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees. There are
flipped T-waves in III and AVF.   I did not have an old
electrocardiogram here for comparison.
 
Therefore, Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with
mild exertion.  He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass
surgery.  He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work
by his physicians, that the Screen Actor's Guild will make a good case for this. 
There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to
return to work as an actor.   Given Mr. Potts's current
feeling, I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon
as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery.
 
It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his 89-
year-old mother at home, along with his wife.  His mother currently
uses a walker, and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot
exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in
the house.  He understands this, and if his chest pain should
become more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediately
call me.  
 
If Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery, I will see him in two
weeks at NDNH.  
 
With best regards.
 
Sincerely,

HPI:. 64 yoM w/ significant PMH for CAD, HTN, GERD, and past cerebral embolism presents w/ 6 hour history of vertiginous symptoms, dizziness, lightheadedness, and feeling ""like [he] was going to pass out"".  The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was ""constantly going out of focus"" and inability to ""lock in on any one thing"".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.



Pt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.  TTE at that time showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.

treatment.  His past medical history is also positive for 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, aortic valve replacement 
with a porcine valve, and ventricular fibrillation.  He is on 
Glucophage and aspirin.  He has no known drug allergies.  The 
patient feels well.  He says that each night he gets fever up to 
101 degrees F., although it is not that high each night.  The 
patient's past medical history is also significant for CAD, with an 
MI in 2092 and ventricular tachycardia in 2086.  His AICD was 
re-done two weeks ago.  He had a triple-A repair in 2089.  He has a 
history of gout. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is well-appearing now, with a 
temperature of 97 degrees F., a pulse of 58, a respiratory rate of 
18 and unlabored, a blood pressure of 110/80, and a room air 
saturation of 96%.  The HEENT examination is negative.  The lungs 
are clear.  The heart has a regular rhythm.  The abdomen is soft 
and non-tender.  The patient appears quite well. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Blood cultures are done. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient's primary care 
physician is contacted and will follow up with the patient.  the 
patient's white blood cell count is 6.  His hematocrit is 40.  His 
potassium is 4.9, his BUN 19, and his creatinine 0.9.  The 
urinalysis is negative for infection.  He has no pulmonary 
infection evident.  There are no ischemic changes on his EKG.  The 
patient appears to be doing well after the AICD replacement.  The 
AICD has not had to fire.

  RE:  Adler, Imogene

  MRN: 618-13-82-6

  

  

  Dear Dr. Yingling:

  

  Thank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,

  for her problem of coronary ischemia.  As you know, Ms.

  Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of

  essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is

  postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest

  tightness associated with exertion.  A stress MIBI SPECT

  study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and

  basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex

  distribution.  The details of the study include an exercise

  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and

  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from

  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and

  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a

  rate pressure product of 33,390).  The test was stopped due

  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.  EKG

  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and

  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.  

  

  Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her

  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and

  verapamil 240mg q.d.  A recent lipid panel demonstrated a

  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.

  

  On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing

  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute

  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.  Jugular

  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.  Carotids

  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.  Chest

  examination was clear to auscultation.  Heart examination

  unremarkable.  Peripheral examination demonstrated no

  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.  

  

  EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal

  EKG.  

  

  I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive

  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the

  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery

  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.  We reviewed the

  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary

  angiography and possible angioplasty.  I made no solid

  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty

  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead

  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical

  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and

  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of

  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and

  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom

  tolerance.  She and her husband are going to reflect on

  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the

  week.  If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography

  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately

  in Cardiology.

  

  I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see

  her in the office.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if

  I can be of any further assistance.

  

  With warm regards,

	Reason for visit:
   Chest pain, shortness of breath


	Interval History:
   Cardiology Admission for Dr. Paulson

69 y.o. male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 presents today to ODC ED with progressively worsening shortness of breath and intermittent left jaw pain. 

The patient reports having undergone CABG in September 2092 at WMMC after developing jaw pain and shortness of breath. He was told at that time that there might be a problem with one of the grafts. Surgery otherwise uneventful. He was discharged home and developed recurrent symptoms. Cardiac catheterization was performed in early Jan 2093 at BS which, by his report, showed one occluded graft. He underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. Relook coronary angiography was performed about 2 weeks later showing no change. He saw Dr. Paulson for 2nd opinion about 2 months ago. His review of angio from Jan: SVG to mid RCA patent, LIMA to 2nd diagonal patent, SVG to LAD not seen and extensive LAD disease. LAD intramyocardial. LV function normal. Ranexa was added however he has not noted any improvement in jaw pain. He has progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and intermittent exertional left jaw pain partially relieved by 2 s.l. TNG. Despite greatly curtailing his activities, he is having daily symptoms. He has been enrolled at cardiac rehab but can only bicycle 2.8 mins. He phoned Dr. Paulson's office today and was advised to come to the ODC ED for evaluation.

In the ED, he appears comfortable and painfree. Did note some left jaw pain earlier. HR 73 SR, BP 122/71, O2 sat 98% RA. ECG showed NSR rate 71, incomplete RBBB with LAFB, LAE, TWI V1-V2-no important change c/w prior tracing 2/18/93. BNP, CK-MB, and TnT normal. CXR shows clear lungs.

In light of his history of CAD, CABG, prior PCI, and progressive symptoms, admitted for further evaluation.

HPI: Since our last visit, saw Cardiology re her neck and jaw pain w exertion, Dr. Uphoff who feels that she has stable angina. he recommended that she optimize her medical management by increasing her BB and CCB. At this point, she has increased her BB to 2 pills 2x per day.  she feels ok on this.  no lightheadedness or dizziness.  She is also going to start nitrates as soon as they arrive--imdur 30mg qd.  still having intermittenly jaw discomfort walking up stairs.  no chest pressure or jaw discomfort at rest. 
she has not gained any wt.  however, has not been able to increase her lantus bc she was not sent the correct amount and would run out if she increaesd to previously recommended dose. 
also started pravastain since our last visit.  has not noticed any muscle aches or generalized weakness. has only been on this for 2 weeks though. 
no hypoglycemia; good energy; feeling well overall. 
describes feeling pressure, fullness in left ear; slight decrease in hearing.

RE:  Wonda Benitez
     MR #892-76-95-4
 
Dear Usha:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,
hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.  As
you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night. 
She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations
whenever she takes the quinine.  She has not been taking this since
the initial two doses.  I suspect that her leg cramps are probably
secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.  I have told her to eat
a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg
cramps in the evening.  In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus
bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.  There is borderline first
degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged
from previous tracing.  We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid
as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.  She will see me in follow-up in
three months' time.
 
Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular
clinic.
 
With warm regards.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Gordon Q. Iniguez, M.D.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Armando Newton, M.D.

Mrs. Francesca Sergio-Steven is a 72-year-old Hispanic female who presents with a new-onset acute MI.  She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.  She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.  She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.  There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.  She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.  She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.  There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.  The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.  The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.  She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.  She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.  Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.  She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.

Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d. and atenolol 50 mg q.d.  She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.  Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.

Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.

Review of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.

On exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular.  Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.  Head and neck were unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.  There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.  There is no S3.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  Calf site is clean without bruits.  Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.

Her resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.

Other lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000.  Liver function tests are normal.

A portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.

Mrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.  She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.

At this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates.  We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.  She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.  At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.

Nathan J Fernandes M.D. 



College Station, NC 22169



Dear Dr. Fernandes:



  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.  It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.  As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.  Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.  When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.  At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.  Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.  Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.  Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.  He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.  He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.



From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.  We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.



	Past medical history:

   Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

CAD.

PAD.

Prior tobacco use.

Obesity.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Depressive disorder.

Cervical spine disease.

Congenital hypospadias.

Prostatitis.

Hemorrhoids.

Colonic polyps.

Chronic normocytic anemia.



	Medications (Confirmed):

	

aspirin  325 mg qd

Atacand  15 mg qd

doxepin 

glyburide 

Lipitor  80 mg qd

Lopid  600 mg BID

Toprol XL  50 mg qd

Wellbutrin 



Physical examination:

	

-Pulse:   66 and regular

-General:   Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress

-Heent:   Benign

-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits

-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs

-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.  S1 and S2.  There is no murmur, rub, or gallop

-Abdomen:   Obese, nontender, and nondistended.  There are no masses or bruits appreciated

-Extremities:   Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits.  Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit.  Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration

-BP: 145/80    on the right



	Other Data:

   Three-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.

Status post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.

Hypospadias repair in childhood.



	Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.



Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.  Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.  On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.  We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.  Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e. CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.  Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.



It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.  Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.  We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.  He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.  He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.  With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.



Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.  We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

I saw this patient and personally obtained the history of present illness.  I also reviewed and confirmed the PMH, medications, social and family history, and detailed ROS. I personally performed a comprehensive cardiovascular examination, including assessment of VS; auscultation of carotid arteries, lungs, heart, and abdomen; palpation of carotid arteries, evaluation of jugular venous pressure, palpation of abdominal aorta and lower extremity pulses and perfusion, and neurologic examination for focal deficits.  I interpreted the EKG and other pertinent laboratory data.  I discussed findings with the patient and personally developed the management strategy and plans.  My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above, with which I concur.  Guy Nunes M.D.

CHIEF PAIN COMPLAINT:  ""I have pain in the back radiating down my legs."" 

 

PAIN HISTORY:  The patient's pain started spontaneously about two years ago.  It is located in the lower back, radiating to the back of the legs, to the level of the knees.  The pain is brought on by walking and made better by stopping or sitting down.  Bending over forward also helps the pain.  There is no numbness or weakness associated with the pain.  The pain is better at night than during the day.  The patient has separate pain complaint, which is burning pain in her feet, is worse at night than during the day.  Patient denies bowel or bladder changes. The patient has tried Celebrex, Vioxx and Motrin but has not found any relief for her pain.  She currently does not take any pain medications.  She denies a history of heartburn, gastric or duodenal ulcers or GI bleeds.  She has trouble falling asleep and staying asleep because of the burning pain in her feet. She is being referred to us by Dr. Ebert from Neurosurgery after an MRI scan showed spinal stenosis at L5-S1 and at L4-5 as well as spondylolithiasis between L4 and L5.  She had been reluctant to undergo surgery and was therefore referred to see if epidural steroid injections could help.  

 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction four years ago.   

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Coronary stent placement times two in December 2074.

Targeted examination showed an age appropriate woman in no apparent distress.  Mental Status:  She was fully awake and alert.  Her mood was appropriate.  There was mild sensory loss in a stocking distribution over the lets as well as in a glove distribution over the hands.  There was no frank allodynia of the feet.  Patellar and ankle reflexes were retained.  Toe response was flexor.  The patient could walk, including heel and toe walk.  There was no pain on straight leg raising.  There was no local tenderness over the back, however, a moderate degree of muscle spasm over the lower back.  

 

IMPRESSION:  

 

1.  Spinal stenosis.  

2.  Diabetic neuropathy.

RE:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion
regarding her current cardiac condition.  As her history is well
known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.  Mrs.
Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of
coronary artery disease.  After several catheterizations in the
2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease
(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071
showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she
was managed medically.  However, she suffered a non-Q wave
myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she
underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary
artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary
bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to
her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse
marginal branch.  She underwent repeat catheterization in February
of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease
but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.  She
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of
a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%
proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis
with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch
and a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant
stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft
to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the
saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.  The left
intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete
stenoses.  Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of
posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%. 
She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center
in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft
to her diagonal artery.  She tolerated this uneventfully and was 
 
 
Olivier, Christine
MR #652-33-21-5                    -2-            July 05, 2074
 
discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest
discomfort.  Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild
exertional dyspnea.  She has undergone extensive pulmonary
evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which
have revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of
1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent
with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.  In
addition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,
hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.  
 
Medications at present:  NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI
insulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric
coated aspirin one tab po q.d., atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Captopril
25 mg po t.i.d., amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po
q.d., nitroglycerin prn, Nitropatch .2 mg for twelve hours of a
twenty-four hour period, Neurontin 300 mg one tab po t.i.d.,
Trusopt one drop ou q.d., Alantin one drop ou q.h.s. and albuterol
inhalers two puffs q.i.d. prn.
 
Cigarettes - none at present.  
 
Physical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in
no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heart
rate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172
pounds.  The neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without
significant bruits.  Chest is clear with a trace right basilar
rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2
and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to
the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is
benign with bowel sounds well heard.  Extremities without
appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.  There is 1+
bipedal edema. 
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.  PR interval
of .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of a
left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1
through V3.  
 
Impression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant 
atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest
exertional dyspnea and fatigue.  She denies any active chest
discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at
alleviating the chest pain syndrome.  The records available to me
indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta
blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an
exacerbation of her angina.  However, now that she is status post
her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker
reduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to
50 mg po q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked within the
next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will

MR #652-33-21-5                    -3-            July 05, 2074
 
also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral
edema and in part because she may no longer need this.  Otherwise,
I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except
to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she
can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in
close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur. 
I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem
appropriate.

Chief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient briefly evaluated on 12/30/88 as part of preoperative evaluation for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy then scheduled for 12/31/88.  Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain.  These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal.  Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting.  Patient denies jaundice.  Today, patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank.



At the time of evaluation on 12/30/88 patients had symptoms of URI and LRI.  She reported back/green sputum, mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandson's inhaler.  After consultation with Dr. Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then follow-up with surgeon to reschedule her surgery.  Patient reports that she went to University Hospital and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler.  Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler.  Currently she denies any symptoms of sputum production, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.  Also denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.



Patient does have a history of coronary artery disease.  She is status post an MI 11/82.  Patient had cardiac catheterization at OSH 12/3/82 that reportedly showed a critical mid right lesion and a mild left main and left anterior descending lesion.  12/09/82 patient underwent cardiac catheterization at PVH and a PTCA was done.  Patient did well until 10/83 when she was admitted to PVH with symptoms of chest tenderness, left arm pain, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, dry mouth, shortness of breath, dizziness, and darkening of revision.  Patient did rule out for MI by serial enzymes and there are no changes seen on her ECG.  Patient denies any difficulty with chest pain or left arm pain since that time.  She has had episodes of shortness of breath with exertion however, these seem more related to her respiratory status rather than her cardiac disease.



Stress test done 1/26 showed a normal exercise capacity (METS=7), ECG nondiagnostic for ischemia and the perfusion images were suggestive of anterior ischemia although body habitus limited the interpretation.

Assessment:  

ASA Physical Status II

56-year-old female with a history of CAD, SLE, hypertension, arthritis, asthma and chronic low back pain presents for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Patient originally scheduled for surgery on 12/31/88 however because of LRI surgery was postponed.  Patient much improved, lungs clear, no wheezing, no shortness of breath.  It has only been three-week since her infection and therefore increased airway reactivity may be an issue.  Dr. Hoffman explained this to patient.  Dr. Hoffman also reviewed with patient medications to take prior to surgery 1/28/89.  Currently, patient denies any symptoms of cardiac ischemia.  Does have chronic chest pain/tenderness which is reproducible by palpation.  Patient states that this is not her ""cardiac pain"".

MOUNTAIN SIDE INTERN ACCEPT NOTE

Patient:  Isenberg, Michael
MRN:  3674193
Date of Admission:  25-March-2064
PCP:  Dr. Charles Uher (DSH)
Attending:  Julian Quintela/Micheal Leyva
 
CC:  Chest pain

HPI:For full details, please see SDU Admission Note of 3/22/64 and SDU transfer note of 3/25/64.  In brief, the patient is a 81 y/o man with CRI, Type II DM and hypertension who was in his USOH until Thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no  radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  The pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.  EMS was called, who brought him to the HCC ED, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an O2 of 85%.  His pain was alleviated with IV NTG, and BiPap improved his O2 saturation.  He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin.  He was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions.  He was sent to the SDU, where he was started on lasix 60IV BID and a CABG pre-op workup was begun.  Since admission to the SDU, he has been stable, with excellent RA sats.  His Troponin-T peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain.
	On the floor, he was stable but had a 15-beat self-limited run of MMVT, his BP was 110/60 and he was asymptomatic, with no chest pain or dyspnea.  He was given 4 gm iv of MgSO4, 60 mEq of KCL.  Repeat cardiac enzymes drawn at the time were significant for a troponin-T of 3.73 but with a CK of 133 (303) and CK-MB of 5.2 (16.2).  

Past Medical History:

Ulises Lopez, M.D.

Mount Ascutney Hospital



RE:  Danny Nielson

MAH#:  



Dear Dr. Lopez:



Thanks very much for referring Mr. Nielson to see me for evaluation of his lymphadenopathy.  I will review his history for you.  Mr. Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman who states that approximately three months ago, he had some increased swelling of his left leg.  About three to four weeks ago, this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon, Indiana.  At that point, a CT scan was performed.  CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2.0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1.5 cm node just posterior to that, also a 1.0 cm retrocrural node was seen.  CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.  The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter.  The patient was then seen by Dr. Lopez on April 12th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  



Wegener s granulomatosis initially diagnosed in 2083.  The patient says at that point he came to the Hilton Head Medical Center with severe photophobia and was diagnosed with scleritis.  This recurred in 2093.  He has been treated intermittently with low-dose azathioprine and steroids.  He is currently on a minimal dose of steroids.

Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly is palpable.  Extremities:  2+ edema on the right and 3+ on the left, pitting.  Lymph node exam:  No anterior or posterior auricular, no anterior or posterior cervical, no submandibular, submental, infraclavicular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  The patient has a 1.0 cm lymph node deep in the right axilla.  No epitrochlear lymphadenopathy.  Inguinal region:  A 4.0 to 5.0 cm left inguinal lymph node mass is palpated.  Neurologic exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact to specific examination.  Strength 5-/5, bilateral grip, bicep, triceps, deltoids, knee flexion and extension.  Sensory exam intact to light touch bilateral upper extremities and decreased sensation to light touch in the left lower extremity.



LABORATORY STUDIES:  



Recent laboratory values from April 12th reveals a creatinine of 1.5, glucose of 244 and calcium of 11.  Liver function tests are within normal limits.  Hemoglobin A1c is 6.  White count of 5.2, hematocrit of 33.9 with an MCV of 81 and a platelet count of 155,000.



IMAGING STUDIES:  



The patient has a PET/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.  To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



1.  Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.  This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.  I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.  I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.  This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.  These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.  I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.  The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.  However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.  I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.  However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.  I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.

2.  Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.  If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.  He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.  The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.  In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.  At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.  At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.  The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.



Sincerely,







Gene Quadri, M.D.

Patient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941
Dictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D. 

 
DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome.  
 
HISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.  The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and ""numbness"" on the right worse than left hand.  This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.  Also bothers him during prolonged activity.  He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.  Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.  He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.   
MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.  
 
ALLERGIES:  None.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.  
Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.  There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and 
very weak opponens.  He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.  His interossei and extensors are full.  Sensation is intact throughout.  
 
EMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.   
IMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.  At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as 
possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.  We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.  We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.  We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

RE:  Urania Yerger

     MR #583-48-90-0

 

Dear Dr. Dillon:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first

time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her

coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in

October of this year.  Though you know her history well, I will

recount it for the purposes of record keeping.  Ms. Yerger is

presently 81 years old.  Her vascular risk factors include

diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  She had no prior diagnosis

of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash

pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST

elevation myocardial infarction.  Coronary angiography at the

Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,

thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent

complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal

as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.  Angiography also

revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.  The patient underwent

subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed

by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.  (SVG to

ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).  Ms. Yerger's postoperative

course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient

episode of atrial fibrillation.  

 

Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of

activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending

shopping trips.  Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve. 

She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.  She has

had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein

graft harvesting.  She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA

symptoms or claudication.  

 

Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.  Ms.

Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on

her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a

possible viral exanthem.  

Yerger, Urania

MR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078

 

Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency

(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and

prior right knee replacement.  

 

Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.

day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril

5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.

day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.

 

Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family

members in the area.  She is currently staying with her daughter. 

At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but

is limited by chronic knee pain.  She denies alcohol or tobacco

use.  Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.

 

On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.  She is

comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her skin is warm and dry. 

She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly

on her extremities.  Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate

is in the 70's.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her

carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Her chest reveals decreased breath

sounds at the left base.  There are no crackles or wheezes. 

Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and

rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased. 

There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the

apex.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her extremities are free

of cyanosis or clubbing.  Distal pulses are 1+.  She has mild edema

of the left lower extremity.

 

Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and

intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.

 

Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after

her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid

October.  Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to

persistent pleural effusion.  We will reevaluate today with a

repeat chest x-ray.  In the meantime, I think that we should

continue her oral diuretic regimen.  It is possible that her

persistent rash is related to her Lasix.  Although not certain to

be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today

in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may

resolve.  I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.  We

will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for

secondary prevention.  I look forward to seeing her again in

approximately eight to twelve weeks.  In addition, she will follow-

up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a

persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her

symptoms.

 

Yerger, Urania

MR #583-48-90-0               -3-            December 14, 2078

 

It is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.  Please do

not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

 

Sincerely yours,

 

 

 

Vaughn A. Xander, M.D.

RE:  Kathy Joshi
     ILC #158-42-11-2
 
Dear Dr. Taylor:
 
Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus.  She continues to
complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally
secondary to exertion.  These episodes occur on a roughly once a
month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes. 
Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no
effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does
not take Nitroglycerin for it.  A stress test performed last
January showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds
of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak
blood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.  She had no ischemic
EKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI
scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small
surrounding area of transient ischemia.  In addition, there was a
moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-
infarct mild ischemia.  Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266
with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192. 
 
She remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d.,
aspirin 1 tab p.o. q.d, Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., NPH 12 units
S.C. q a.m. with 6 units CZI S.C. q a.m., and 15 units NPH S.C. q
p.m.. 
 
Physical exam reveals a well nourished, overweight woman in no
acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 160/90, heart
rate 67 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 264
pounds, which is six pounds above her weight of one year ago.  The
neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2 + without bruits.  Chest

Kathy Joshi
ILC #158-42-11-2

remains clear.  Cardiac exam reveals normal S1, physiologically
split S2 and a soft I/VI systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen is
benign.  Extremities without appreciable edema.  
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, P-R interval
.22, QRS .10, Q-T .36, axis 20 degrees.  There are isolated atrial
premature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV block
and a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor
nonspecific ST and T wave changes.  Compared to his last
electrocardiogram there has been no significant change.
 
Impression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable
angina.  I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q h.s.
for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to
more aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her
aerobic activity level.  In addition, I have asked her to obtain
her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an
ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above
140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic
antihypertensive therapy.  In addition, as long as she remains
active and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI
stress test in one to one and a half years time.  Beyond this I
have not altered her present regimen. 
 
Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care.
 
Respectfully yours,

HPI

51 yo F with MMP comes to establish primary care as she is unhappy with the cre she is geting at CityMemorial. She was 40 mislate to her appt and time was limited. She has multiple medical problems for which she is on a variety of medications, none o which she has taken x1 month as she ran out of refills.



1. CVA-She reports 3-4 mos ago she had a stroke (she was told there was a clot in her brain) which left the L side of her face paralyzed and some residual weakness in her LUE. She also notes her handwriting has completely changed since. Since the stroke she has had multiple episodes during which her tongue becomes very heavy and she has difficulty speaking (distinctly different from her now mildly imapired baseline) At these times she feel somewhat confused and her L vison seems blurry. This has happened 4-5 times and lasts all day. er family has encouraged her to seek medical care but she has refused bc she did not think they would do antyhing for her. Of note, pt has not been on ASA as it was d/cd when she changed to celebrex. Pt also c/o memory loss that started even before the CVA.



2. CAD-She reports a h/o multiple MIs, incl cardiac cath x2, unknown if she had intevention, she thinks the last was about 1 yr ago. She has stable 3 pillow orthopnea. She becomes SOB when she climbs 5 steps and gets SOB sometimes when she walks, which resolves ith rest, but she is able to walk a fair amt still (cannot pin down how much).  She denies CP with exertion, did have CP with her MIs. She says smx she has lower and upper extremity edema. She has not had a recent ETT.



3. DM-Pt has been on glucophage and Humulin 70/30 100U in am and 60 in pm, but has not been monitoring her BS or taking insulin for the past month. She has all the necessary equipment. She says she tries o monior her carb intake. She has been gaining weight, bout 5 lbs in the past 2 mos, and notes polydypsia and polyuria fo the past 2 weeks.



4. HTN-has not been taking Zestoretic or Atenolol x1 mo



5. Depression-Pt has h/o depression for which she has been medicated in the past. She currently feels she has very depressed mood, apathy, trouble sleeping and with memory tasks. She denies SI/HI/AH.



6. In terms of health maintenance, her last PAP was 2 yrs ago as was her last Mammo. Her last HgA1C is fr 199 as are her lipids.

Neurology ED Consult Note



Patient: Klein, Michelle

MRN:	2474410

Date: 	2/6/50

Time: 	10:00 p.m.

PCP:	Whitney Keller, M.D.



Reason for consult: garbled speech



HPI:   Patient is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144) who was in her USOH until this afternoon at 12:15 p.m. when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband.  This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.  She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.   The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.  In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.

	ELIZABETHTOWN STATE HOSPITAL
	

RE:  I had the pleasure of seeing Verna Cantu in consultation today for management of coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.

Dear Dr. Levon Nichols,

  She is a very pleasant 60 year old female with cardiovascular risk factors of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and prior tobacco abuse. She has no prior history of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure. About 15 years ago she underwent an ETT for evaluation of exertional lightheadedness which by her reports was unremarkable. 
She has an extensive vascular history s/p right popliteal PTA/Stent and left common femoral endarterectomy for which she has been receiving regular care from Dr. Nichols. She has a history of mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's for which she has been followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson. 

She reports that for the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion which typically manifests itself when she is trying to climb the 2.5 flights of stairs that she has at home. She feels shortness of breath requiring her to stop when she gets to the top. She denies exertional chest pain or lightheadedness. She denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema. She denies lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope. Currently she reports no symptoms of claudication. No regular exercise. A couple of times a day. Bowls on Sunday night with no shortness of breath. She has also been noted to have a systolic murmur on previous exams. An echocardiogram in 2094 revealed aortic valve leaflet thickening but did not report significant aortic stenosis, though this was a technically difficult study by report. 

For evaluation of these symptoms she underwent an ETT-MIBI which was notable for poor exercise capacity, drop in blood pressure, exercise induced LBBB, and perfusion abnormality suggesting distal LAD territory ischemia. 



	Past medical history:
   1. Diabetes Mellitus: On oral medications for 7 years +Retinopathy both eyes ~ 7 yrs ago, no nephropathy. +neuropathy 
2. Hypertension controlled on medication ~ 5yrs, requiring frequent adjustments of meds, 140/70 
3. Peripheral arterial disease. Status post left common femoral endarterectomy by Dr. Vanover 11/26/95. 
4. Carotid artery disease. Mild bilateral internal carotid artery stenoses duplex ultrasound 6/96. 
5. Mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's. Followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson. In 2094 was having leg pains. 
6. Melanoma involving right thigh. s/p surgical resection 20 years ago 
7. Arthritis primarily of hands 

Prior surgeries: tonsillectomy, melanoma resection. 

Supplements: 
Calcium with Vit. D.

 Impression: 65 year old gentleman with multiple stroke risk factors, onset of dysarthria, aphasia, dizziness, ataxia at 13:00 today. Symptoms improving over first 30-60 minutes, but residual RUE drift, dysarthria, and (initally) upgoing R toe. Suspicious for L MCA cortical event. L ICA stenosis and/or embolic event +/- fetal left PCA possible concerns (?cortical vs v-b etiology of dizziness). Cannot obtain CTA secondary to elevated creatinine.  



Plan:  

1.	Admit to RDA 

2.	MRI/MRA. MR Perfusion study if L ICA stenosis or suggestion of intracranial stenosis. 

3.	As event occurred on ASA, provide heparin PTT 60-80, continue ASA at decreased dose (81 qD). Watch platelets, as pt starting with platelets =  150

4.	Hold antihypertensive, but continue isosorbide for known cardiac ischemic history. 

5.	Echo, Holter (for known bradycardia; eval for events with HR <<40. 

6.	PT/speech therapy. 

7.	Careful glycemic control (holding metformin).

Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.

Has been feeling well. 



Home Blood Tests:  Records downloaded from meter with little detail and somewhat scattered BS.

B 	57-448

L	71-222

S	101-254

HS	163-399

No food records. No severe hypoglycemia. Has had a couple of nocturnal reactions. There are not enough data points to determine whether the Lantus dose is appropriate.



Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Aragon over the spring. Has had extensive laser in the past, and had some last year OS after her surgery.

Nephropathy:	Her creatinine was stable at 1.3 in July

Neuropathy:	Feet are not bothering her. Sometimes has a peculiar diffuse tingling sensation precipitated by motion. 

Cardiac:	No chest pain. No unusual dyspnea on exertion. Has been able to exercise in the gym twice a week, walking steadily at a pretty fast pace for an hour. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: no significant changes

Immunizations. Has not had flu shot yet this year. Had the second of hepatitis A series in L deltoid today.



Review of Systems: above

Breast: Saw Dr. Bruce a few weeks ago. Ultrasound showed what is being interpreted as a stable slightly enlarge intramammary lymph node. She find the lower part of the sternotomy scar to be very uncomfortable in most bras and wants to consider whether it can be improved.

Gyn: Overdue to see Yareli Kilgore; she will make the appointment.

Skin: Has noted some crusting lesions on her scalp.



Physical Exam:	

Looks well. In very good spirits. Jake is with her.

BP:   134/80		P:   72	Seated

BP:   116/76		P:   76	Standing

Wt:   168 without shoes, stable

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to percussion and auscultation

	There is a small keloid at the inferior portion of the median sternotomy scar

Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  No gallops.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	No edema.        DP 1+,=.  PT 1+,=.  No open areas of feet. Has several toe deformities, dystrophic nails and probable onychomycosis.

Skin:	Crusting lesion on scalp



Impressions and Plan:	

Hard to assess control. She is reluctant to keep hand records.

Will try to add an ACE inhibitor again. Start captopril 6.25 mg bid and increase the 12.5 mg bid if tolerated. Check BP at home.

She would like to consider treatment for onychomycosis. Would suggest that Dr. Xie send a paring for fungal culture before we consider it. Also, LFTs were slightly abnormal in July and will need to be repeated. Finally, would have to check medication incompatibilities before proceeding.

Refer to Dr. xia for consideration of modification of her sternotomy scar. Warned her that he may not feel that it is a good idea either on pure surgical grounds on because of her immunosuppression, but it is worth asking his opinion.

Refer to Dr. Keeler for evaluation of scalp lesions.

Flu shot R deltoid with usual preamble. Aventis Fluzone Lot L5317YR. Exp. 7/10/76.

A1c, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, Bili T/D, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine 

Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine again in 1 month if she is taking captopril at that time.

NAME:     Hendrickson, Ora 

MRN:      7194334



This patient is here for a follow-up.  She was seen with a very complete evaluation 

by Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.  She submitted a

urine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her

urine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.  A fair amount retained

as postvoid residual.  Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with

resolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor

and cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.  She

has anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent

infections.  She is most concerned about having cancer.  She is scheduled to see Dr.

Quezada March 24th.  The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have

been issues going around the housing projects.  A 14-year-old girl was raped and

one week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment. 

She ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.  She did not file a

police report.  As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.  She

reports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix

approximately one week ago.  She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet

sporadically but not on a regular basis.  She denies any chest pressure or

palpitations.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She denies any problems with

pain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.



PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm. 

No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.  Her

ankle reveals trace edema on the left.  Her right extremity is warm to palpation.  



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Hypertension.  Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.  This

     may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.  I have

     restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d. on a regular

     basis.  



(2)  Anxiety.  I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try

     to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.



(3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.  She had a urine culture submitted today. 

     She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.  She

     will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.  I attempted to

     reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current

     recurrent infections.  It is more likely due to her cystocele.



(4)  Peripheral vascular disease.  This appears stable.  She remains off the

     cigarettes.  



(5)  ASCVD.  She remains without symptoms.  



(6)  GERD.  She remains on the Prilosec.



(7)  Hyperlipidemia.  She remains on Lipitor.  She should have a repeat

     cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.



(8)  Borderline high sugar.  The patient should also have this rechecked with the

     new physician in the fall.

EDVISIT^42521583^ZASTROW, IRENE^11/01/85^CONNER, VICKIE

The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation

reviewed by me and I concur.  In addition, I personally

interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who

presents for evaluation of chest pain.  The patient had no

history of coronary artery disease until the last week.  She was

apparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week.  She

had been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort. 

She considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums. 

After approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that the

discomfort was not improving.  She did feel like that she had

less energy for her usual activity.  She went to a hospital there

in her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive

troponin.  She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did

show multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.  She subsequently

underwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.  She did

have recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which was

much more severe, sharper in nature per her description.  She was

told in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.

 She returned home today, called her primary care physician and

was advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. 

She does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvania

earlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of more

severe left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhat

more sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencing

before.  It is not always associated with exertion.  It sometimes

radiates to her left shoulder.  It is not pleuritic in nature. 

It seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low level

of dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since her

discharge from Pennsylvania.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She

is able to lie flat.  Denies any lower extremity edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for type 1 diabetes, which is

fairly brittle per her report.  She is status post MI within the

last week.  She also has a remote history of PE in the past and

is no longer on Coumadin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She lives with her husband

and has recently returned from Pennsylvania.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for CAD.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems are reviewed and are also

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Include insulin, Plavix, aspirin, Nexium, Lipitor,

and atenolol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to iodine and Indocin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 65,

respirations 18, and blood pressure 105/69.  The patient is

awake, alert, pleasant female who is reclining in no acute

distress.  Her head examination is normocephalic and atraumatic. 

Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Her sclerae are

anicteric.  Her conjunctivae are pink and moist.  She has moist

mucous membranes and appears well hydrated.  Her neck is supple

and nontender with full range of motion.  The JVP is not

elevated.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with

equal breath sounds, no respiratory distress.  No accessory

muscle use and no chest wall tenderness.  Her cardiac examination

is regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Her

abdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender.  No guarding, no

peritoneal signs, and no organomegaly.  Her skin is intact, warm,

dry, and slightly pale.  There are no rashes.  Her back is

nontender with full range of motion.  Extremities reveal no

cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Her calves are soft and nontender

with no palpable cords and full range of motion with normal

strength and tone.  She is alert and oriented x3, very pleasant. 

Cranial nerves are intact, and there is no motor or sensory

deficit.  Rectal examination performed by the resident reveals

heme-negative stool with normal tone.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was placed on a cardiac

monitor.  IV access was maintained.  Laboratory studies were sent

and EKG was also ordered.  Her prior records from Pennsylvania were

reviewed.  Her white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 37, and

platelets 285,000.  Her electrolytes are within normal limits. 

Her BUN is 18, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 112.  Her CK here

returned normal at 33.  Her MB was 0.4.  Her troponin returned

elevated at 0.39.  This is in comparison to the troponin from her

records of Pennsylvania, which was 0.2.  Her d-dimer is less than 200.

 Her INR is 1.1.  The patient had an EKG, which showed evidence

of a new T-wave inversions, present on prior EKG from this

hospital.  She was started on heparin for concern of unstable

angina status post MI, remained hemodynamically stable, and is

admitted to the Cardiac Service.

DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain, rule out unstable angina.

HOLCOMB,DENNIS   833-12-06-0                       VISIT DATE: 05/09/21

This patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well 

as Dr. Petty whose I have reviewed and whose findings I have 

confirmed.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 53-year-old male who 

presents with complaints of palpitations, shortness of breath and a 

general feeling of weakness.  The patient states he has been 

feeling unwell for the past three days and has noticed his heart 

racing.  He actually has had his significant other take his heart 

rate and blood pressure while he was at home, and his readings have 

been in the 1 teens to 120s.  The patient has had a decreased 

appetite with vomiting and nausea as well as chest tightness in his 

mid-chest.  The patient felt himself get worse, and he, therefore, 

presents to the emergency department.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the written note.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the written note.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

male in moderate distress.  Pulse 160-177, respiratory rate 40, 

blood pressure is 130/68, oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.  

NECK:  Supple, full range of motion, no jugular venous distension.  

CARDIAC:  Regular, tachycardic, no murmur is auscultated, clear S1 

and S2.  LUNGS:  Positive rales at the bases, otherwise clear, good 

air movement, tachypneic.  NEURO:  Alert and oriented x 3, follows 

all commands appropriate.  Further details of the exam are as per 

the written note.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Labs are significant for a glucose of 322, 

BUN of 31, creatinine of 1.8, bicarbonate of 19, CK of 186, MB of 

4.0, troponin of 1.11, calcium of 9.9.  White count of 15.6, 

hematocrit of 47.6, platelets of 206.  PT of 14.0, PTT of 29.0.  

EKG shows wide complex, regular, tachycardia.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen, interviewed 

and examined in the emergency department with labs obtained and as 

documented above.  In addition to the above studies, the patient 

had a chest x-ray which shows increased pulmonary vasculature.  The 

patient's EKG along with his history is concerning for a 

ventricular tachycardia.  The patient, therefore, initially 

received amiodarone.  The amiodarone affected no change in the 

patient's heart rate.  The patient remained tachypneic and 

tachycardic and generally well appearing.  The decision was made to 

proceed with cardioversion.  The patient received morphine and 

Ativan and had a synchronized cardioversion once at 52 volts with 

immediate change to sinus tachycardia in the 1 teens.  The patient 

stated that his chest tightness resolved immediately following 

cardioversion.  The patient received aspirin, beta-blockers, oxygen 

and heparin while in the emergency department.  He is on amiodarone 

drip.  Individuals from the Cardiac Service were contacted 

regarding possibly getting the patient to the catheterization lab 

especially in light of his ruling in for a myocardial infarction.  

The plan at this time is for the patient to be admitted to the CCU, 

be observed and then to proceed to cardiac catheterization 

thereafter.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Cardiac Service.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Myocardial infarction.

2.  Ventricular tachycardia.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted in satisfactory condition.  Critical care time is 70 

minutes.

Esposito, Perla
#146-55-23-5                                 November 11, 2076
 
Has had no exertional chest pains.  Urinates two to three times a
night but not very frequently during the day.  Ran out of her
Lopressor yesterday.  Continues to have some discomfort in her
right buttock radiating down the side of her leg.  Not happy with
the orthotics that were given her for her arch pain because she can
only use them with bulkier shoes.  Has had some right shoulder
discomfort.  
 
Meds:  Procardia XL 120 mg. q.d.  Aspirin 325 mg. q.d.  Lopressor
100 mg. b.i.d.  Micronase 5 mg. q.d.  
 
W. 141.  176/90 in the left arm, 178/90 in the right.  80.  Good
range of motion of the right shoulder.  There is some crepitance
over the AC joint.  No subdeltoid or bicipital tendon tenderness. 
Full range of motion.  Lungs are clear.  Soft, positive S4.  No
pedal edema.
 
1.  CAD.  Doing well without angina.
 
2.  Hypertension.  I renewed her Lopressor. Will recheck this after
she has been taking both medications faithfully.
 
3.  Diabetes.  Will check a glucose today and I renewed her
Micronase.
 
4.  Question right sciatica.  She is not interested in any invasive
therapy so we will not pursue imaging at this time.  She had a
negative CT in 2073.  I put her on 400 mg. of Motrin three times a
day.
 
5.  Arch pain.  This is clearly not that bothersome that she feels
that it is more important to wear lighter shoes.  
 
6.  Right shoulder pain. She may have some mild rotator cuff
tendinitis. We discussed the importance of not overusing this
shoulder and avoiding lifting anything heavier than a coffee cup. 
Motrin 400 mg. t.i.d. on a full stomach.  I showed her some range
of motion exercises.

SABINE MEDICAL CENTER



Reason for visit:

   Follow up: NSVT and history of VF Arrest



Interval History:

   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today. His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.



His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.  Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.  Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.



He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring ""rarely"", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol.  The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.



He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.



Past medical history:

   DMII, CAD, s/p CABG, VF Arrest Hypercholesterolemia, 1st Degree AV block, RBBB, NSVT



Medications (Confirmed):



			

Dalmane 30 mg

glyburide 2.5mg po qd

Lipitor 20 mg

lisinopril 5 mg po qd

metformin hydrochloride 500 mg

Nexium 40mg po qd



Physical examination:

-BP: 110/70  

-Pulse: 50  

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ pedal pulses.



EKG:

   Sinus Bradycardia 50bpm, 1st degree AV block PR 290ms, RBBB. Compared to previous EKGs, PR interval is slightly longer.



Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath. I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise. We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.  We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.



The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.

HISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.  He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking. He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  

He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.  He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.  He has not had any rest pain.  For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.  He then had a left brachial artery.  Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.  There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.  With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.  He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.  He is married and lives in Missouri.

MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.  Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.  He had no jugular venous distention.  Chest was clear.  Heart had normal S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4.  There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.  His abdomen was benign.  Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.

IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.  His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.

IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.  We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.  We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.  We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

       Procedure: This 73 year old male with Cervical Herniation is scheduled for a Cervical Laminectomy with Fusion on Jan. 21, 2095 by Dr. Noah Blanchard



       Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: This 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.  He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.  He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081. He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects. Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.  evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally





        Past Medical History:  

1.  Paraplegia secondary to Compression fracture in Amusement Park accident in 2066

2.  cervical spondylosis

3.  COPD uses prn Albuterol MDI

4.  CAD S/P CABG X3 in 2087 catheterization done in March 2090.  Recent stress done in May 2094

History of CABG, known hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, dyspnea on exertion, cancer, smoking. S/P B/L CEA, Cath '90 - occluded SVG to Cx, patent LIMA. patent SVG to RCA. Admitted with (L) sided chest pain, ruled out for MI by enzymes. Ruled out for aortic dissection by CT. Last Adeno-MIBI 3/2092 - posterior wall MI, Negative for ischemia. PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia. DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain. Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia. MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan. PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise. Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min. Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec). 1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired. Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day. Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made. STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur. REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities. Sinus bradycardia 56/min. First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test. Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited. SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study. Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.

               73 year old male with cervical disc herniation scheduled for Cervical  Laminectomy with fusion on Jan. 24, 2094 by Dr Blanchard.  He has co morbid diseases IDDM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, COPD, Paraplegia, Hx of uti and depression. His last surgery was in 2092 ORIF left Tibia IV sedation with spinal anesthesia no complication noted in anesthesai record..  There has been difficulty placing the IV ( pt said this happens a lot). According to note from 3/07/81 anesthesia for previous cervical Laminectomy  Rapid sequence induction MAC #3 8.0 ETT easy intubation. Pt was a smoker for 50 years occasionally uses Albuterol with a spacer suggested he use it pre op .  He had a stress test done in May 2094 and it was negative for ischemia and a LVEF was 50%.  Report in this note under Medical Problems.  He was admitted for ""chest pain "" in May 2094 and he no longer is using the NTG sl or the Nitropace.  He was told the ""pains"" he feels is most likely from his CABG ( CABG X3)- Grafts to RCA patent,occluded at circumflex, LIMA patent and the post sternal pain. The stress test was done during this admission as well as a CAT scan to r/o aortic dissection. ( also negative)  his biggest problem seems to be his ""not very well controlled diabetes"".  There is a note from the May 2094 admission that he was to receive a trial of Nexium to see if his ""chest pain"" was epigastric"" but pt and wife said he never received this medication.  He denies any GERD or ""chest pain"" since may 2094.  He recognizes his hypoglycemia sx's and  also his hyper glycemia sx's ( blurred vision) when his blood sugar is 480.

 Youssef Null
Ludlow Medical Center

Post, IN 86454

Dear Dr. Null, 

I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up of his recent admission to the ICMA.  While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records.  He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.  MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.  He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA.  After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.  Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.  His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.  He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.  He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.  

Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.  Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.  

He has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes.  He feels well, and has had no problems.  He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea.  He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication.  He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's.  His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.  

His past medical history includes:
 CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
 VF arrest in setting of STEMI
 Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
 LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
 hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
 hypothyroid
 basal cell skin CA
 nephrolithiasis

His medications include:
 Lipitor 80 mg
 Plavix 75 mg
 ASA 325 mg po QD
 Lopressor 200 mg po BID
 Prilosec 20 mg

He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.

His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.

He works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job.  He is now back at work.  He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.  He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.  He has never smoked cigarettes.  He drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam.

On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75.  He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.  His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.  His abdomen is benign.  He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.

His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.  He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.

His recent cardiac tests include: 
 - echo 2/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease
 - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s/p Angiojet/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result 

In summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA.  He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event.  Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.  Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.  Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.  His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.  I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.  We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.  

Given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.  Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.  At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing.  

It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.  I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.  

Regards,

Name:  Nathan Vieira
Medical Record:  #0666729
Date of Evaluation:  12/13/78
Attending:  Dr. Atwood

CC:  L leg/foot pain

History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.  He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.  However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.  This lasted for ~24 hours.  He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.  He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.  He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.  On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

Sandpoint, MI 58543                             CK759182
(033) 250-1408                                12-27-92
 
 
HPI: Kadeem Vicente comes in today for a follow-up office visit.  The 
patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and 
whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for 
which he suffered a ""silent heart attack"" many years ago, a history of 
benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD.  As it 
turns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the 
beneficial effects of which were unknown.  We had decided as of our last 
meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.  The 
patient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will 
continue to discontinue this medicine.  At this point, the patient does 
not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec.  
With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he 
wanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago.  
Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.  It is 
noted that his blood pressure was 152/74, which is better than it was 
the last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and 
diastolic was 80-90.  The patient reports no new symptomatology other 
than occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest.  The patient 
has no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no 
ankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are 
remarkably normal, given his medical complaints.  The patient's 
cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.  Review 
of systems otherwise negative.
 
Physical exam is not performed at this time.  Blood pressure was 152/76 
on the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 
and unlabored, and pulse was 70.
 
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical 
problems coming in for follow-up.
1.   Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use 
     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic 
     hypertrophy.  The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, 
     and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while 
     standing.  The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which 
     hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic 
     hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped.  If 
     the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to 
     Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
 
2.   BPH - please see above.  The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.
 
3.   ? coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a 
     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable 
     for this gentleman.  I do not have an HDL in which to judge his 
     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s

     or low 50s.  Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without 
     therapy.  I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in 
     about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he 
     will be put on an antilipid drug.
 
4.   GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I 
     will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this 
     point.  Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be 
     placed on Prilosec.
 
I will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of 
his use of Hytrin.

VUONG,XOCHILT R   515-31-23-5                  VISIT DATE: 01/15/61
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Bleeding. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 71 year old female status 
post cardiac cath stent placement and then later EP study states 
that she was doing well until last night when she started to ooze 
from the groin site.  She did not apply any pressure.  She states 
that she was bleeding through the night, did not want to bother her 
brother, called Dr. Aponte today who told her to come in.  She 
states that she did not know where the site was.  She could not see 
it and she did not apply pressure.  She has no chest pain, no 
shortness of breath.  She is not dizzy.  She is on Lovenox and 
Coumadin both.  She has not had her PT checked.  The rest of the 
systems were reviewed and are negative. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression, cardiac cath, hypothyroidism. 
MEDICATIONS:  Taken from the chart. 
ALLERGIES:  Taken from the chart. 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her brother. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her heart rate was 81, her temperature is 
96.5 degrees, blood pressure is 123/64.  This is a well-developed 
female, alert, oriented.  HEENT exam is atraumatic, normocephalic. 
Neck is soft and supple.  Mouth and throat are normal. 
Well-hydrated moist mucosa.  Conjunctiva are clear.  Sclerae are 
non-icteric.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Heart had a 
regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to auscultation 
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender.  No guarding.  No 
hepatosplenomegaly.  There is a hematoma at the right groin.  The 
cath site was about 1 cm and closed but there was some small oozing 
from the site.  It stopped with pressure.  The patient was covered 
in blood and blood clots.  The old dressing was removed.  All the 
dried blood and blood clots were removed.  The patient was cleaned 
up by myself.  Then, the nurses put her in the hospital gown. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  PT, PTT, CBC were obtained. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  After speaking with the patient at 
length, it seems that she lives with her older brother.  She is 
caring for him and is a bit overwhelmed with this.  Obviously, her 
medical knowledge base is not adequately prepared to deal with this 
problem.  She will be admitted to the Observation Area through the 
day for nurse training.  Social Services will be consulted to 
arrange for a home visiting nurse.  Dr. Aponte was called. 
CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Social Services and Dr. Aponte. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Bleeding from cath site and knowledge deficit. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  See the chart 
for disposition.

3)	h/o HCV postive 60-68, since then negative x2

4)	Hypertension.

5)	Hypercholesterolemia

6)	Gout for several years, several attacks, responding to Colchizine

7)	Obstructive sleep apnea, on Bipap

Social-, Work-, and Family- History

Married with other lung transplant recipient (tx 9 years ago). No family history of renal disease. Nonsmoker, Marketing Manager.



ROS:

Good appetite, no skin itching. Drinks little according to wife. Poor energy level. Heart, lung, GI system without abnormal finding. No renal stones, no recurrent UTIs, urine amount unchanged. Occasional cramping while walking. Exercises in fitness studio.



Physical Exam

BP     R 150/105  L  145/100		HR    	64	weight 327 lbs. 

FS limited due to cataract. Moon facies, short neck.

Today	UA     1.015/5.0/1+P. 

	Sed     one cast with dense pigmented inclusion (?cells),otherwise bland.



Impression and Plan

Mr Albert has progressive renal insufficiency, he does currently not require renal replacement therapy. Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration. However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration. Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.



I took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies. Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment. For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.



Bobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks. At that point he will be evaluated for Epogen/Aranesp.

(584) 728-8734

SUBJECTIVE: The patient returns.  She has had three
operations on her back, finally ending with a fusion of
L2-L3 and a laminectomy in that area for recurrent disk
disease  at L2-L3.  She still is having severe pain going
down her right leg and anterior knee which is unchanged or
perhaps somewhat better.  She sees Dr. Herring with
regularity.  She has seen Dr. Oscar Riggs.  She has
nothing wrong with her hips and she has had multiple CT
scans showing the numerous operations and fusion.  

MEDICATIONS:  
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d. 
2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d. 
3.  Trandate 100 mg q.d.  
4.  Tegretol 300 mg in a.m., 200 mg in the p.m.  
5.  Premarin 0.625 mg 30 days a month.  
6.  Provera 5 mg 12 days a month.
7.  Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg q.d. 
8.  Calcium 1200 mg q.d. 

She is in physiotherapy presently. She is not smoking nor
drinking.  She has been eating and has gained considerable
weight.

She has no cardiopulmonary, GI or GU complaints.  She is to
see Dr. Bruce Godfrey's replacement in August and to get a
mammogram at that time.  Hopefully, she will be able to lie
on the table when that occurs.  She is now able to drive a
car, but walks with a cane and cannot lie down with any
degree of ease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She weighs 192 lbs stripped and her
blood pressure is 160/90 in the left arm standing, pulse is
72 and regular.  She appears as a well developed, overweight
white female in pain, having to hold on while standing,
easily weeping, but pleasant.  There is no icterus, cyanosis
or edema.  The eyes reveal 2+ arcus.  Pupils are round,
reactive and equal.  Nose and throat examination is
unremarkable.  Neck veins are flat.  Carotids are 2+ and
equal and without bruit.  Thyroid small and smooth.  Lungs
are clear to P&A. The heart is not enlarged.  There is a
regular sinus rhythm and no significant murmurs.  S1 and S2
are normal.  Liver and spleen cannot be felt.  She has good
peripheral pulses.

IMPRESSION:  
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.  She has had an eye exam at
Mitchel Memorial Hospital this past year, but her diabetes is poorly
controlled as her blood sugars have been in the 150-200
range.  I have told her to increase her Glynase to 3 mg
twice a day until she is able to diet.
2.  L2-L3 disk with fusion. 
3.  Mild hypertension, on no medication.  Will not start any
until she loses weight.

Full code



Contact information: 



CC/HPI:  

27yo male from Cedar Hill Lakes, Nevada w/ history of insulin-requiring DM previously followed at Cottage Sanatorium, admitted to Linden Health Care Center after becoming unresponsive during a visit to his sister in Maryland. By report, patient was sitting on the couch at his sister's house, slumped to the floor and had seizure activity x 45seconds that was witnessed by EMS sevices. Accu-checks done at that time were >500 and attempts at intubation were unsuccessful. He was transported to ER, where additional attempts to secure his airway were also unsuccessful, by 2 physicians. There appeared to be some sot of stricture in the upper airway (not obvious on CT scan). However, pt had witnessed emesis, and was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask, with Versed and propofol for sedation with adequate O2 saturation. A x-ray confirmed dependent lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia, and pt was started on Clindamycin.



On arrival to the ER, patient was also found to have a blood pressure of 248/146. He received 50mg dose of labetolol in the ER as well as several additional doses in the ICU. In the ICU, patient did not have any further witnessed seizure activity. A Head CT demonstrated no focal lesion, IC hemorrhage or other abnormality. Pt was treated with dilantin and IV insulin infusion. Serum ketones were negative. Additional workup revealed LVH by EKG criteria, as well as renal insufficiency Cr 2.6. Urine tox was positive for benzos, but was otherwise negative.



Patient also developed leukoytosis (WBC ?) with temp of 102 degrees. Although he had minimal neck stiffness by neurology consult exam, he underwent a lumbar puncture that demonstrated a colorless clear fluid, with glucose of 108, TP 44. Grams stain was negative. Tube #4 contained 21RBCs and 7 WBCs with a diff of 96% PMNs and 4% lymphs. CSF cultures and blood cultures were also done, and are pending.



During his hospital course, patient maintained adequate oxygenation with nasal trumpet in place. ABG on 08/25/61 am was 7.36/PCO2 45/ PO2 366, with bicarb of 25 and 100% sats. His FIO2 was subsequently weaned. He remained hemodynamically stable with BP 184/88 (MAP 114) HR100, RR23, 97% on cannula. Cardiac enzymes were negative. After patient's mother arrived from Georgia, she requested transfer to BMH.



Had no reported history of hypertension or seizure disorders. Mother reports patient having occasional spells in the past, lasting 5-10minutes where patient would become non communicative, associated with elevated glucose.

EKG: NSR, borderline LVH

CXR:  perihilar opacities, o/w clear.



Assessment and Plan:  27yo h/o insulin dependent DM, not medically followed, p/w witnessed seizure episode in context of severe hypertension.



1.	Neuro - seizure episode / unresponsiveness with non localizing neuro exam. Concern for hypertensive encephalopathy. Pt had LP at outside hospital which did not suggest meningitis. Other possibilities include infarct, encephalitis. Neurology consulted, with recommendations for:

n	EEG 

n	MRI w/ susceptibility  to evaluate for posterior leukoencephalopathy, MRA head/neck, MRV brain

n Dilantin (continued from OSH)

n	Check tox screen, ammonia. Mother has brought in some unknown pills which we will try to identify.

2.	ID - increased WBC, low grade temp s/p LP. No bacterial source for now, but CXR with opacities suspicious for pneumonia. Will start Vancomycin and cefepime empirically, and narrow per culture results. Concern for encephalitis, as HSV can present w/ HTN and seizures. Will ask Linden Health to add HSV PCR to CSF taken from LP prior to transfer. Start Acyclovir empirically in interim.

3.	Resp - s/p multiple attempted intubations at OSH, currently breathing adequately on RA, with audible obstructive physiology. Given need for MRI, may have to sedate and intubate. Will call anesthesia. Continue intubated until MS more alert, for airway protection. Will start ARDSnet for criteria meeting low PaO2/FIO2 ratio and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

4.	CV- severe hypertension w/ evidence of potential end organ damage (kidney/brain/cardiac). Will control BP w/ Nipride drip, with addition of labetalol for HR control. Target goal 25% decrease to SPB~160 today, and SBP 120 the following day. Check CK/TPNs. Continue IVF for potential rhabdo.

5.	Renal - Renal failure w/ Cr 2.6, unclear baseline. Suspect acute on chronic component given DM w/ poor follow-up. Will check Urine sediment, lytes to evaluate. Reading by me is +hyaline/waxy casts but no WBC or RBC casts. Kidney U/S pending, also with Doppler to evaluate for RAS. Also check urine renin/aldo and 24hr metanephrine for pheochromocytoma, serum metanephrine, and 24hr protein for nephritic syndrome in presence of HTN and hematuria.

6.	Endo - tight glucose control; CZI drip for DM. Has gap but No ketones at OSH; did not arrive in DKA. Will need reg insulin after drip DC'd in future.

7.	Access - PIV

8.	Prophylaxis - nexium, heparin SQ, peridex, HOB 30.

54 yo male from Kazakhstan here for f/u of GI mucor.  Briefly, he was admitted 6/20/62 with DKA and MSSA bacteremia.  He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p CT-guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on 7/07 and by IR 7/22, both sites positive for MSSA.  Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p ex-lap 6/22, gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection, splenectomy and primary anastamosis, with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.  He also had VRE/klebsiella LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage.  

He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.  So he was switched to vanco/ambisome/linezolid/meropenem/amikacin for LUQ abscess.  After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons ""scooped out"" as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions. 
Given the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge's GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.  This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.  He was started on this drug on 8/28/62 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea, diarrhea.  

He has been at EDUCARE-FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.  He walks with a walker.  He had repeat CT abd/pelvix 10/26 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection.  He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain, without much output.  He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition, despite po intake.  He has been trying to eat, but reports some nausea and diarrhea, especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole.  He reports good glycemic control.  He denies fevers/abd pain/nightsweats/chills/visual changes/HA/melena/cough/SOB.

Imp:

54 yo male with DM s/p long hospital course for DKA, multiple infections in hip and abd, and GI mucor s/p resection x2, but with residual disease.  Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well, but does have significant nausea, somewhat controlled with zofran.  Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect, or due to dumping syndrome.



Plan:

1) continue posaconazole

2) need to have ortho f/u to evaluate L hip collection

3) RTC in 1 month 12/04/62 at 10am to f/u for posaconazole.  Will need EKG again at EDUCARE-FARGO before transfer here.



Mr. Ethridge seen and examined with Dr. Roberts.  He is very slowly improving in terms of strength, no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN.  Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea, although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects.  On balance, if his labs are ok, I'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings.  ECG without QTc prolongation.  Abdomen is bening.  Left hip still sore, but more and more stable.

                                              6-19-59
 
 
 
HPI:  This is a regularly scheduled visit for this Eva Ruledge a 
44-year old woman with a history of hypertension and borderline obesity.  
She was last here in February with no complaints, but did have an elevated 
creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further 
evaluation.  The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as 
planned.  She states that she has been ""too busy.""  Her only complaint 
today is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is 
relieved to some extent by acetaminophen.  
 
Eva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.  A noted in her 
ambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug, however, 
Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than 
on an almost p.r.n. basis.  
 
Review of systems is essentially normal.  Specifically, she denies any 
headaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.  She also denies any 
symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.  She has no history of 
dysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.
 
Physical Examination:  She is robust appearing.  Vital signs are 
significant for a blood pressure of 140/100.  HEENT exam is unremarkable.  
Lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal 
S1, S2.  No S3 is appreciated.  There are no murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen is 
slightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.  No masses are 
appreciated.  Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not 
suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.  Indeed, exam of 
her legs is entirely unremarkable.  
 
Laboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine 
sediment and a urine creatinine.
 
Assessment and Plan:
 
1.   Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure 
     on her Procardia.  I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which 
     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, 
     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.  I will see her in a few days in order 
     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug 
     and also to check her blood pressure once again.
 
2.   Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be 
     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the 
     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)  I  have asked her to continue taking 
     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, 
     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.

                                              6-19-59
 
 
 
3.   Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal 
     appointment.  In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I 
     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.  
     She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have 
     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.  
     Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this 
     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney 
     function.  
 
4.   Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear 
     today, but again was ""too busy to stay that long.""  She is to see me 
     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.  Her 
     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and 
     will not be repeated until next year.

Evergreen Court Hospital
97 Factory Street
Haleyville, MN 78826   

RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D.
    MR #863-35-65-5

Dear Dr. Faust: 

Thank you for kindly referring your patient, Jacob Rodriquez, to the
Internal Medicine for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.
Although I'm sure you are familiar with his history, I will review
it now for our records. Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired Electrician
at Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent
health until the past year. He denies any prior history of
hypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significant
childhood illnesses or malignancy. He describes his usual baseline
health as excellent. He is a religious walker, walking multiple
times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast. Dr.
Rodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he
was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia. This was treated with
Metformin. Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added
apparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe
he has been diagnosed with hypertension). He subsequently developed
diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was
subsequently reduced in dose. In June of the past year the patient
was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his
Hydrochlorothiazide. At that time he also was found to have lower
extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the
Hydrochlorothiazide. The patient states in September of 2119 he
traveled to trinidad and tobago. While in trinidad and tobago he had a
marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he
found it difficult to ambulate. He denied any difficulty with chest
pains or shortness of breath. He had no hemoptysis and no focal
unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility
during the trip. He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an
ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema
significantly. However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this
medication and it was stopped. Subsequently his lower extremity has
once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of
Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn. At the present
time Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath. He
still able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any 

Page 2
Freeman Faust, M.D. 
RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. 
January 18, 2120


limitation. He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling
in his lower extremities. He has no chest pain, has no cough, no
sputum production, no hemoptysis. He has no fevers or chills. He
believes his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several
months. He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation. He
denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note
that he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is
often napping in the reclining chair which is new for him. He
denies any history of snoring. He has noted no new joint complaints
although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of
his right lower extremity as well as on his left arm. This has been
present for approximately two or three months. Other than that he
believes his bowel and bladder function is normal. Review of
systems is otherwise unremarkable. 

His past medical history is significant for:
     1. Type II diabetes as above. 
     2. An apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his 
        chart. 
     3. Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide. 
     4. Past history of right bundle branch block. He has no      
        history of rheumatic fever. 

Current medications include Atenolol 25mg daily, folic acid,
Glucophage 850mg bid, Lasix 120mg daily, Lisinopril 15mg daily,
compression stockings, Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently. 

Drug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to
Hydrochlorothiazide. 

Family history is significant for diabetes mellitus. 

Social history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an
immigrant from trinidad and tobago. He has been living in Haleyville
since the early 2059's. He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo. He
has minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his
bachelor's degree but none since then. He is a non tobacco user. He
uses alcohol minimally. He's never had any blood transfusions. He
lives with his wife. They have no pets. He does not enjoy any
unusual hobbies not noted above. He has been exposed to
tuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD. 

On physical examination today Dr. Rodriquez weighs 193 pounds. Blood
pressure is 136/90. Pulse 83 and regular. Respiratory rate is 20.
Temperature is 96.8. Resting oxygen saturation is 98-99% with
ambulation in the hallway. This fell to a minimum of 97% with an
increase in his heart rate to 100. HEENT exam is significant for a
clear oropharynx. Sclera are white. Conjunctiva are minimally pale.

RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. 
January 18, 2120


The thyroid gland is normal. Jugular venous distention to
approximately 10 cm. was noted. Neck was supple. Examination of the
chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness
at both bases. There was no egophony and no wheezes. Otherwise the
lungs were clear. Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated. No RV heave
or lift was appreciated. No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.
The pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced. No appreciable
murmurs were detected. The point of maximum impulse was in the
anterior axillary line. Examination of the abdomen revealed a
nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths
below the right costal margin. This was nontender and smooth.
Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well. Normal bowel
sounds were present. Examination of the extremities reveal three
plus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower
extremities, one plus edema was also present in both upper
extremities. No clubbing was noted. There were no skin changes
consistent with collagen vascular disease. Multiple follicular
lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as
well as on the left arm. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. 

Objective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a
white count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250.
Differential was not remarkable. LVH is elevated at 599, AST is
most recently 22. A urinalysis on 12/07/19 was negative for
protein. No reportive cast was made. A CEA was notable for a level
of 2.4 on 1/05/20. An echocardiogram obtained on 12/22/19
demonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved
LV function. The right ventricle was mildly dilated and
hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function. There was trace
MR with moderate TR. A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus
right atrial pressure was noted. 

In summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut
pulmonary hypertension. The etiology of this is not clear at the
moment. Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic
disease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive
sleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease. In addition some
patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the
setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left
ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of
exclusion. The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree
with increasing his diuretic regimen. I'm embarking on a course of
evaluation to exclude the most likely causes. In specific he will
be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic
disease this afternoon. This has already been arranged by Dr.
Faust. In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an
antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70. I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez
Page 4
Freeman Faust, M.D. 
RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. 
January 18, 2120


to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea. He
will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal
pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an
arterial blood gas drawn. If this evaluation should be unrevealing,
he may require more invasive diagnostics. I've already consulted
formally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most
experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would
be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our
workup is nondiagnostic.  

Dr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.
I'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after
his diagnostic tests have been performed. Please do not hesitate to
call me with any further questions or concerns. 

Sincerely, 




Jose Church, M.D.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Marsh is a 73-year-old male who comes for first visit to TRMC to initiate longitudinal care and follow up of multiple medical problems.



PROBLEMS:

1.  Chronic renal failure.  He has been on dialysis for the past four years.  He is currently dialyzed two times per week.  He apparently had been three times per week in the past.

2.  Hyperlipidemia.  Fasting lipid analysis one year ago showed total cholesterol 225, triglycerides 265, LDL 161, and HDL 40.  He has not been treated.

3.  Hyperparathyroidism.  PTH level one year ago was 143.  He is on calcium replacement.

4.  IgG monoclonal gammopathy.  This was noted on immunoelectrophoresis.  It was at very low levels.



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg q.d., Nephrocaps one q.d., and PhosLo 2001 mg t.i.d. by his report.



REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  He states he was told he was hypertensive at last dialysis. No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  



ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears well.  Blood pressure on multiple measurements range from 150-160/78-82, weight 144 pounds, and heart rate 72 and regular.  Chest: Clear to percussion and auscultation.  Cardiovascular exam:  No extra sounds or murmurs.  Abdominal exam:  No masses, tenderness, or organomegaly.  Extremities: No edema.  Skin: No rash.  Musculoskeletal exam: Grossly intact.



ASSESSMENT/PLAN:

1.  Chronic renal failure.  The patient will continue on dialysis.  I have requested screening blood tests.

2.  Hyperlipidemia.  This needs to be treated.  I have asked him to return for reestablishment of baseline.

3.  Hyperparathyroidism.  Secondary to chronic renal failure.  He is on calcium replacement.

4.  Low-grade IgG monoclonal gammopathy. Will recheck values and follow.

5.  Hypertension.  A degrees systolic hypertension warrants therapy.  He is due for dialysis tomorrow, however.  I gave him a prescription for atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.

6.  Adult health maintenance.  I gave him a prescription for aspirin, which he should be taking and asked him to return in two weeks for a full annual review.

  I instructed him to show renal staff the prescriptions tomorrow at dialysis.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 61 year old gentleman
here for his first visit to me as his PCP, referred by Dr.
Xavier.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/PAST MEDICAL HISTORY BY PROBLEMS:
 The patient has no acute complaints today.  His medical
history includes:
1.  Hypertension.  He is currently on hydrochlorothiazide 25
mg q.d. and aspirin q.d.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is on 30 mg q.h.s. of
simvastatin.  His last lipid panel in April of this year
showed total cholesterol of 196, triglycerides 169, HDL 52,
and LDL of 110.  He has no LFTs on file.
3.  Psychiatry.  According to the patient, he carried a
diagnosis of major depression with paranoid features.  He is
being followed by Dr. Uhler, psychiatrist at Marshfield Clinic as well as Betty Villasenor, a therapist at Marshfield Clinic.  He is currently on Depakote, Tegretol, Risperdal,
and Paxil although he does not know the doses of his
medications.  He still feels depressed but his paranoid
symptoms have subsided.  He has no manic or hypermanic
episodes.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Paxil, Risperdal,
Tegretol, Depakote doses unknown, simvastatin 30 mg q.h.s.,
HCTZ 20 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs.
 He quit drinking alcohol 16 years ago.  He has not been
sexually active for 16 years and is currently not
interested.  He lives by himself in  Denver Drive, walks
about 20 minutes per day, and is from Louisa originally.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother and father died of MIs in their 70s.
 There is no history of sudden cardiac death.  No cancer,
liver, kidney, or thyroid disease in the family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 132/84, heart rate 84,
and weight 202 pounds.  The remainder of the exam is
deferred.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Hypertension.  The patient is well controlled on his
current regimen.  I will therefore not change anything
today.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is at his goal LDL
level.  I will continue to follow his lipid panel yearly.  I
will also check LFTs today, given that he had a statin.
3.  Psychiatry.  The patient will follow up with his
psychiatrist and therapist.  He will let me know his actual
medication and medication doses at his earliest convenience.
 Also, I will recheck an LFT as stated above, given that he
is on possibly hepatotoxic psychoactive medications.
4.  Healthcare maintenance.  I have emphasized to the
patient the benefits of weight reduction as well as
increasing his exercise.  He is not interested in any
exercise as in walking and I have therefore counseled him to
walk longer and faster.  He had a negative flexible
sigmoidoscopy in November 2083 and I will give him stool
cards today.  His last tetanus was 10 years ago and he is
not interested in the booster today.  His immunizations are
otherwise up to date according to him and he will need the
remainder of the history and a full physical exam at the
next visit in 3 months' time.

RUTLEDGE,XAVIER W.   539-54-14-3               VISIT DATE: 04/28/65
This patient was seen with Dr. Russell, medicine resident.  The 
chief complaint, history of presenting illness, past medical 
history, medications, allergies, social history, family history and 
review of systems are as noted by Dr. Russell on the record, and 
were reviewed with her and with the patient. 
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chills, temperature to 104 degrees. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a 56 year old 
man status post renal transplant, who was recently admitted to a 
hospital for rising creatinine.  Tests showed that he had 
cyclosporine toxicity of his graft and cyclosporine was reduced. 
He was discharged home yesterday.  This was confirmed by biopsy. 
He was fine overnight, but then had some chills this morning, and 
presented to the Emergency Department with a temperature of 104 
degrees. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Is as noted by Dr. Russell on the record 
and basically does not identify a source of infection.  The chest 
is clear to auscultation.  The abdomen is soft with the exception 
of some tenderness over his graft site.  The wound site was 
apparently inspected by the admitting team and was not found to 
show any evidence of infection. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratory studies are still pending. 
Cultures were obtained of both blood and urine. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fevers, status post renal transplant. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Disposition - 
admission.  Condition satisfactory.  The primary physician, Dr. 
Oviedo, was notified.

OFFICE VISIT:  10/14/84



This 28-year-old young woman, status post two failed renal transplants, re-presents for evaluation.  She is less depressed, more upbeat.  Now a year since her father's death (? drug overdose).



She is on tapering prednisone after her severe rejection for noncompliance. She has multiple access problems, history of seizures, and severe hyperparathyroidism.  



Medications:  Her meds include Prednisone 2 mg in the a.m., Nephrocaps, Prilosec 20 q.d., Midodrine 5 mg only before dialysis, Diltanin 400 mg b.i.d., Tegretol 250 b.i.d., Renagel 4 caps at breafast, lunch, dinner, 3 capsules with snacks plus 2 tablespoons Alternagel, Doxepin 50 q.h.s., Coumadin 5 mg, Xanax 4-5 tablets of 0.5 q.d., Celexa 20.



Allergies:  She has allergies to Cipro, Demerol, penicillin, and gets red man syndrome from Vanco if given rapidly.  



She has seasonal allergies and takes Zyrtec 10 mg, Flonase 2 sprays each nostril, Albuterol 2 puffs 4x a day as needed, and Advair 2 puffs as needed.



Social History:  She is taking 1 course at computer school.



Physical Examination: Her blood pressure was 170/90 - this is much higher for her.  She has conjunctival injection, which is her acute red eye of uremia.  Neck is supple.  Carotid upstroke is normal.  Thyroid is not enlarged.  Chest is clear. She is chronically ill appearing.  She has an S4, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Bowel sounds are normal.

IDENTIFICATION:  This 65-year-old man with a 5-year history of cardiomyopathy is is admitted with worsening heart failure and recent presyncope for further evaluation.  He was diagnosed with progressive shortness of breath in 2078.  He was treated with diuretics and other medications at that time.  He did quite well until December of last year when he had a cardiac arrest and underwent ICD placement.  He has had worsening symptoms over the last year with increasing shortness of breath on flat ground and a very severe shortness of breath with stairs.  He has had some episodic nature to this.  Two days prior to admission, he had relatively rapid onset of shortness of breath while trying to play pool.  This recurred several times associated with diaphoresis.  He had no palpitations at that time.  He has no chest discomfort.

His past medical history is significant for history of shower emboli and TIA in 2081.  He has diabetes.  He had spinal stenosis surgery in 2078.

His current medical regimen is Bumex 3, recently decreased from 12 due to worsening renal function.  He is on spironolactone described as 6.25 daily, digoxin 0.125, Toprol-XL 12.5.  He has been on carvedilol, which was changed due to dizziness.  He is on lisinopril 1.25 mg and has had great difficulty tolerating any higher dose due to dizziness.  He is on metolazone 2.5 weekly.  He takes Coumadin 7.5 mg most days.  He is on insulin and Lantus.  He has no known drug allergies.

His family history is essentially unremarkable.  Mother unknown, father had onset of angina in his 80s.  The patient lives with his wife and son and is a retired Fire Chief.  He had an 80-pack-year smoking history but quit four years ago.  He has one glass of alcohol every 1-2 weeks.

Review of systems is negative for any problems with fevers, chills, change in his bowel or bladder habits.  He has no problems with swallowing.  He has no problems with hearing or vision.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.

On physical examination, blood pressure is 84/66 in the left arm and 86/62 in the right arm.  His chest is completely clear to auscultation and percussion.  Temperature is 35.9.  His heart rate is 100 and a regular rhythm.  His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave, which is visible.  He has a palpable and audible third heart sound.  The right ventricular impulse is present also.  He has a systolic murmur, which is heard everywhere, not otherwise easy to characterize.  It does not change with respiration.  The second component of the second sound is slightly increased in radiation consistent with a PA systolic pressure in the range of 50-60.  His legs are cool.  Venous pattern is very prominent.  His pulses are intact peripherally.  He has no abdominal bruits.  His jugular venous pressure is 14 cm.  He has no cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly.  His liver percusses at approximately 5 cm below the costal margin.  He has some increased resonance around the umbilicus.  Laterally, there is suggestion of some fluid in the distention.  There is no peripheral edema.  His joints are without obvious deformities, although he describes arthritis in his shoulder, neck, and back.  He has no skin rashes or sores, several very small ecchymoses.  His standing blood pressure is unchanged.  He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 98.

ASSESSMENT:
1.  Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined.  We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography.  The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.  He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.  However, the episodicity is significant.
2.  Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern.  His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.  However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected.  It is also possible that this is related to angina.
3.  Other related risks.  He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.  It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.

There are no obvious contraindications to transplant.  At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation.  Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion.  We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.

Major Problems

Diabetes mellitus

Blood sugars have been good at home.  Hemoglobin A1c's have been good.  We are rechecking that again.

Hypertension

Blood pressure is okay today, 140/68.  We will need to follow this closely.  Her potassium has been up a little bit.  We will need to change around her medications to see if the Norvasc that we put her on increased her potassium.

Health maintenance

She continues to decline sigmoidoscopy and mammogram.  The patient's cyst at the left leg has been removed and is well healed at this time.



Physical examination

Blood pressure 140/68  

Weight   166 pounds

Neck   Thyroid exam is unremarkable

Nodes   No lymphadenopathy

Chest   Lungs are clear with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi

Cor   No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Carotids with normal upstroke without bruits

Extrem   Clear



Disposition

Return is to see me later in the spring.  Diabetes care is up-to-date.  She has her eyes checked and feet followed closely.  We will later discuss with her any further followup about the diabetes with Nutrition.

September 28, 2132  Endocrine/Diabetes



Present Illness:  

Asked to see this 66 year old man who was transferred to LEPROSARIUM for care of an ischemic R foot. He has had a series of illness over the spring, beginning with a hospitalization for pneumonia in June. He later developed what was thought to be a splenic subcapsular hematoma (on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation) and then subsequently developed LUQ pain and was found to have a splenic abscess that was drained. In the course of this illness, he also developed an ischemic R foot and was found (at what stage?) to have a popliteal aneurysm. 



At the time of his admission, he was found to have diabetes. He has been treated with Lantus insulin, most recently 15 Units at bedtime, on which regimen he has had consistent overnight drops, often to hypoglycemic levels. He reports that he weighed about 200 pounds before this illness but has lost about 50 pounds. 



Retinopathy:   He has had an eye exam in the recent past but I do not know any details.

Nephropathy:  BUN/Cr 8/0.77

Neuropathy:    Do not get a history of peripheral neuropathy

Cardiac:           Aware of having atrial fibrillation for about 4 years. Not aware of any history of coronary artery disease.

Past Medical History:  

Surgery:                       R elbow surgery

                                    Umbilical hernia repair

Medical:                      Hypertension   

                                    Hyperlipidemia

                                    Chronic atrial fibrillation

Allergies:                     No known drug allergies.

Smoking History:        None.

Alcohol History:         Occasional 6-pack for a football game



Family History:  

Father:             Also developed, or was found to have, diabetes in the context of another illness within the last decade and now takes insulin in his 80&#8217;s.



Social History: 

Lives with his wife.



Review of Systems: above

Review of systems is otherwise negative.




Physical Exam:   

Pleasant man in no distress, flat p angio.

BP:   120-140/60-80                            P:   60&#8217;s-70&#8217;s, irregularly irregular       

Wt:   about 150 by history                  Ht: about 5&#8217;9.5&#8221;

Abdomen:       No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. Mild LUQ tenderness. Upper abdominal scar is well healed.

Extremities:     R forefoot appears gangrenous. L foot is not ischemic but no pedal pulses are palpable.            



Impressions and Plan:   


66 year old man with gangrenous R foot and evidence for PVD on L as well.

Diabetes, type 2, of uncertain duration.

A1c is being checked.

D/C Lantus.

Start NPH 10 Units qAM.

After he is through with surgical procedure, it is unlikely that he will need insulin.



Thanks.

MR#:     78361343
Date of admit:      5/18/02
Date of consult:   5/19/02 
 


Reason for consult: Sarcoidosis


History of Present Illness:  Mrs Haynes is a very pleasant 67 yo female pmh significant for a diagnosis of sarcoidosis from a nodule biopsies on her left eye back in October.  She subsequently underwent a mediastinoscopy in April of this year for bulky adenopathy which the pathology was also consistent with sarcoidosis.  She present for evaluation of abdominal pain that has been present for months but became unbearable prompting a visit to the emergency room.  Mrs. Haynes reports that over the past few months she has been experiencing weight loss, early satiety, night sweats and fatigue.  He abdominal pain is described as a sharp to achy pain that started in her right side, progressed to her epigastric and suprapubic are and then her left side.  Currently it is diffuse associated with nausea and vomiting.  She denies bowel problems has had some difficulty with urination and some frequency since admission but this is generally not a problem.  ROS is also pertinet for HA which are chronic and palpations both of which are hard to describe.
 
ROS: In detail otherwise unremarkable.


Past Medical History:  

HTN, Hyperlipidemia (h/o normal stress test in past), palpitations, GERD, thyroid nodules, lichen sclerosis, bilateral adrenal adenomas, diabetes mellitus type II, sarcoidosis

Family History:   Sister x 2 w/MI, Sister w/DM type II, Niece w/DM type II, Brother w/prostate CA, Brother w/possible leukemia, Mother w CVA. No Hx of sarcoid or TB in the family.




Social History:  The patient is a lifelong nonsmoker with a 20 year exposure to secondhand smoke.  The patient has no known asbestos exposure.  The patient is widowed with four children and is retired from her former job at Lowe's.  She was born in Georgia moved to Chelsea in the 50's and the only place she has visited was Augusta.  No TB exposures or risk factors.  States she had been tested for TB in the past years ago.  No beryllium exposure.

CT abdomen Pelvis-  5/18/02   
 
IMPRESSION:           1. Urothelial thickening involving renal pelvises, ureters, and     bladder. Findings consistent with infection versus less likely     inflammation.     2. Bladder calculus.     3. Abdominal lymphadenopathy, increased since prior study, may be     consistent with progression of known sarcoid, versus malignancy.     4. Adrenal nodules, unchanged.
 
CT Chest 3/16
 
IMPRESSION:     1. Mediastinal, bilateral hilar, supraclavicular,     retroperitoneal, and gastrohepatic adenopathy likely represents     lymphoma rather than sarcoidosis given the patient age and     abdominal involvement.     2. Bilateral adrenal nodules.
 
Path: 04/10/2102 PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED ""4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY"" (including FSA):     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE).B. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED ""4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY"":     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE).


Impression:  Mrs. Haynes is a pleasant 67 yo female with biopsy demonstrating non-caesating granululoma in a left eye nodule and mediastinal lymph nodes.  Cx data was not obtained.  However, hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors.  Clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis.  At this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids.  At this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and Dr. Villalpando.


Recommendations:  
 
-Would consider Cardiac MRI given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment.
-Would recommend checking PPD
-Would recommend starting prednisone 30mg po qday.  Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow.  There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr. Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs. Haynes.
-Would also recommend Bactrim prophylaxis while she is on greater than 15 mg Po prednisone.  1 DS M/W/F.
-Will follow.




Thank you for this interesting consult. Please call with questions.
 
Patient seen examine and case discussed with Dr. Layton.

Palacios, NE  73819                             97198841
                                              12-21-88
 
 
 
Patient is a 34-year-old man who comes in for follow up on his newly 
diagnosed type II diabetes.  He has been very compliant with his 
medication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and NPH 
insulin subQ q.AM.  He has had 2 episodes of sweating, but he did not 
check his blood sugar at the time.  He has not had any frank 
palpitations or lightheadedness.  He did have 1 episode where he had the 
sensation of several extra heart beats.  This was not accompanied by 
other symptoms including no chest pain.  He has never had a fingerstick 
blood glucose below the mid 150's.  I am looking through his log and see 
that his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before 
dinner they have been between 157-296.  He has already met several times 
with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his 
therapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a 
diabetic diet.  
 
On physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood 
pressure is 132/78 in the right arm sitting.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars. I will increase his 
insulin regimen.  He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his 
new regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units 
before bedtime.  And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and 
I have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as 
syringes and needles, #60, refills 3.  He is to follow up with me in 
several months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns.  I have 
advised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining 
his diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any 
symptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading 
at that time as well.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Ms. Xia is a 53 year old woman who comes in in 
follow up. She notes that she is still having occasional sweats at 
night. She is using the clonidine but she can't take it two times a day, 
it makes her too sleepy, so she takes it about 3:30 towards the end of 
her workday and then again before she goes to bed. She is having some 
right lower back pain and otherwise is feeling well.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except as noted. She is also taking the 
Cozaar which she had been taking before. 

She was called back in today as a result of labs which were done 
recently which showed hemoglobin A1C of 8.7, an elevated urine 
microalbuminuria and hypertension which needed follow up.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam today, she is well developed and well 
nourished in no acute distress. Blood pressure 158/116, pulse 80, weight 
166. Pupils are equal and equally reactive to light. Lids and 
conjunctiva normal. Retinal fields normal. Disks sharp. Mouth and 
pharynx without erythema or exudate. No adenopathy or tenderness in the 
submandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas. 
Heart sounds: S1, S2, with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the 
right sternal border. No rub or gallop. Her chest was clear to 
auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or 
rhonchi. She was clear to percussion. She has normal bowel sounds. Her 
abdomen was soft and nontender, no mass, organomegaly, and no guarding, 
no rebound. Her extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing. She 
has no spine or flank tenderness. Her neck is supple, no bruits. Her 
skin is essentially quite dry and itchy. She has multiple dark, 
hyperpigmented, post-inflammatory scarring on her lower extremities. Her 
mouth and pharynx are without erythema or exudate. 

IMPRESSION/PLAN:
1. Hypertension. Her blood pressure is really not well controlled. I 
will add atenolol to her regimen 50mg PO q.d. She drinks one cup of 
coffee a day and rarely has alcohol although she notes that she will 
occasionally have one, a scotch, on Friday or Saturday. She does not do 
drugs. She will return in three week for follow up of her blood 
pressure and at that time for a physical exam for which she will be due. 

2. Diabetes. The patient had been told in the past that she had diabetes 
but she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it. Her 
creatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her 
elevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment. We will start her on 
Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. I expect we will need to increase this and if 
she tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week. 
I also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat 
or if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication. I suggested 
she actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is 
eating. I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry. She also 
requested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with

Patient Name: WILHELM, GOLDY;  MRN: 9543443

Dictated at: 05/06/2092 by EDWARD XAYASANE, M.D. 



 

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right leg pain and difficulty walking.   

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Wilhelm is a 68-year-old right-handed female who has had a three-week history of having right leg pain and difficulty walking. She states that her pain started about three weeks ago when she was bending and picking up a pot. She states she had a pain in her back that radiated around her right side down her groin into her medial leg, not past the knee. She states that it went away at that time. The next day she felt worsened and had difficulty working and saw her physician.  An MRI was ordered. Since then, she feels about 60-75 percent better. She states that her pain is constant and describes it as a sharp pain. She does state she feels weak and her knee would buckle. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She states she uses a walker to get to her bathroom, however, otherwise stays in the recliner. Her symptoms are increased with lying down and standing and decreased with sitting.  

 

Therapeutically, she has not received any physical therapy or occupational therapy. She is currently taking Darvocet, however, less frequently, and Celebrex for arthritis. Diagnostically, she has had an MRI scan in April 2092 that showed multi-level spinal stenosis, most prominent at L3/L4, especially on the right side, secondary to facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum infolding, as well as possibly a mild disk bulge. Her mammogram was done in 2091 which was okay. She has not had a bone mineral density at this time.  

 

MEDICATIONS: Currently, the medication she is on is Celebrex, Hyzaar for her blood pressure, and Darvocet for her pain.   

ALLERGIES: She states that taking Tylenol With Codeine gives her toes a burning sensation, and ibuprofen causes tinnitus.   

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has got high blood pressure and shoulder arthritis.  

 

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had a left breast biopsy which she states was not cancerous.  

 

SOCIAL/FUNCTIONAL HISTORY: She is functionally currently not working. She is taking sick time. She has not worked for the past three weeks. She is a Head Nurse and worked at The Library Corporation for the last 35 years. She states her job is medium as far as intensity of work. Functionally, her activities of daily living are limited, and she uses an assistive device.  

 

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and she has four healthy children, ages 51, 50, 48, and 46. She does not smoke or drink.   

FAMILY HISTORY: She has aunts with diabetes and brother that had an myocardial infarction at 59.  

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, no fevers, chills, recent infections, bladder, thyroid problems, rash, shortness of breath, palpations, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bowel or bladder or sexual problems or urination difficulty.  She does have some joint pain and swelling in her shoulders and her feet occasionally. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She does have some trouble walking secondary to the pain. She does not feel fatigued and her appetite is okay and she does not feel anxious or stressed. She does have some mild trouble with sleeping, however, this has improved over the last few days.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, well-developed, well-nourished, well-groomed, normal mood and affect, but slightly anxious with movement, female in no acute distress at this time. On musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine, flexion was within normal limits. Extension she had her type of pain at about 10-20 degrees. Side-bending was unremarkable. On hip examination she had some decreased internal rotation on the right when compared to the left. Straight leg raise bilaterally was negative, however, supine, slight guarding on the right.  Femoral stretch was positive on the right but not on the left. On neurological examination, as far as motor examination, there is some slight decrease, half a grade, quadriceps and hip flexors; however, this was functional; otherwise unremarkable on the right or the left. Her reflexes were 2 plus in the achilles. Babinskis were downgoing, 1 plus at the patella on the right, and 2 plus on the left. Sensory examination slightly decreased at L3 on the right; however, normal throughout; otherwise, gait was antalgic on the right and she did not want to bear weight.  

 

IMPRESSION:  

1. Right L3 acute radiculopathy secondary to herniated disk and facet arthropathy.  

2. Functional limitations secondary to pain, causing her functional weakness.  

 

RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L3 and L4 on the right.  

2. Physical therapy after her injection.  

3. Continue her medications of Darvocet and Celebrex.  4. Keep her out of work until she is able to receive the injection, as well as continue with her physical therapy to improve her strength, given her acute radiculopathy.   

The patient was seen and examined with Dr. Xayasane, who agrees with the plan above.

MULLINS,DOLORES U   728-41-92-0               VISIT DATE: 01/24/73

This patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well 

as Dr. Hawkins whose note I reviewed and with which I agree.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 70-year-old female who 

presents with inability to control her left arm and left leg.  The 

patient had onset of her symptoms approximately two hours prior to 

arrival.  The patient denies any change in sensation but she 

definitely did notice weakness with decreased ability to control 

her left side extremities.  The patient states that her left arm 

control was regained after approximately one or two hours.  Her 

left leg control is better but still is not back to baseline.  

Review of systems, family history and social history as per the 

resident's note.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 

hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Diltiazem, labetalol.

ALLERGIES:  TETANUS.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

female, in mild distress, appears concerned.  Temperature is 96.9 

degrees, pulse 65, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure is 

163/104.  Repeat blood pressure is 174/80.  Oxygen saturation is 

97% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are 

equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular 

motions are intact.  No nystagmus.  NECK:  Supple with full range 

of motion.  2+ carotids, no bruits.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and 

rhythm.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Extremities 

are nontender to palpation throughout.  NEURO:  Alert, oriented x 

3.  Follows commands, appropriate.  Cranial nerves II-XII are 

intact.  There is 5/5 motor strength in individual motor group 

testing of the upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally. 

The patient is unable to stand without assistance.  Comprehension 

is within normal limits.  Further details of the physical 

examination are as per the resident's note.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Labs are significant for a glucose of 162, 

BUN of 20, creatinine 1.3, sodium 145, potassium 4.2, chloride 108, 

bicarb 26, calcium 9.4.  White count is 8.1, hematocrit 39.0, 

platelets 341.  A UA shows no blood, no leucocyte esterase, no 

ketones.  Head CT shows no acute intracranial abnormality and mild 

involutional changes.  EKG shows a sinus rhythm at 57 beats per 

minute with non-specific T wave changes.  This is compared to an 

EKG from 2068 and was found to be without significant change.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated 

in the Emergency Department with labs and studies obtained as 

documented above.  The initial concerns were for a focal seizure 

versus a TIA.  The patient was hypertensive on her arrival and, 

therefore, received labetalol for improved blood pressure control 

and the Neurology Service was consulted early in the patient's 

care.  The patient does not have any evidence of focal motor group 

weakness at this time, nor sensation changes.  The patient will 

require admission to the Neurology Service for further workup of 

her seizure versus TIA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  TIA.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

DATE OF BIRTH:  09/12/81.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.  The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.  In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.  There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.  This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.  The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.  She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.

The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.

She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.  The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.  Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.  Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.  There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.

On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.  MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.  The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.  MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.  Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.

Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.  It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.  Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.  Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.  There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.  The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.  There are no medication allergies reported.

PAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.

Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.  She uses alcohol occasionally.  She has a 12th grade education.  She lives alone and is a widow.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.  The patient is overweight.  Height is 5 foot 3 inches.  Weight is 217 pounds.  Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.  Poor neck posture is noted.  Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.  Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Temporal arteries are normal.  Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.  Romberg is negative.  Tandem gait is normal.  The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.  There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.  This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.  There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.

NEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.  Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.  Extraocular movements are full.  Visual fields are intact.  There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.  Visual fields are intact.  Hearing is intact.  Oropharynx is normal.  Palate elevates well.  Tongue is midline.  Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.  Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.  There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.  Coordination testing today seemed intact.

Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.  Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.  Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.

IMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.  Comment.  I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.  I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.  Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.  In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.  It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.

PLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.  She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.  We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.  We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.  It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.  For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.  I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.  She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.  We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient and the resident, Dr. Vanburen.  Please see his note for

full details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67-year-old female who presents to

triage complaining of substernal chest pain, diaphoretic.  Triage

note states that she is complaining of substernal chest pain

radiating to the neck with this and diaphoresis.  She is cool and

pale.  Her triage vital signs showed pulse of 148, up to 180s. 

She was tachypneic.  Her blood pressure was unobtainable and her

sats were 90% on room air.  She is hypoxic.  She was afebrile,

temperature 96.  She was immediately brought back to room.  At

that time, she complained of palpitations, diaphoresis, and chest

pain since 10 p.m.  She has had no history of an MI.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She does have history of hypertension,

diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies any tobacco or IV drugs or any other

drugs.  She lives with her family who is at her bedside.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has had bilateral tubal ligation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Currently, chest pain, palpitations,

diaphoresis, and shortness of breath.  Otherwise, all systems are

negative.

MEDICATIONS:  She is on metformin and Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, in moderate distress.

 She is tachycardic to 180 in the monitor.  Her blood pressure is

not able to be obtained at this time.  Her saturations are 100%

on room air, normal interpretation.  She is alert, awake and

oriented, follows commands.  Her head is atraumatic.  Her pharynx

diaphoretic.  Extremities are without pedal edema.  She is

oriented x3 with no cranial nerve and no motor or sensory

deficits.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was placed on a monitor, EKG

and received oxygen as well with this.  She was explained that

she was going to receive adenosine 6 mg and this did break her

off from her SVT.  I was present during this time.  She had an

EKG that then transformed to normal sinus rhythm at 91 with an

incomplete right bundle-branch block with no previous to compare.

 She received aspirin, Lopressor, and nitroglycerin and remained

hemodynamically stable throughout her ED stay.  For her

tachycardia and chest pain, we ruled out AFib, complex

tachycardia, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome. 

She was admitted for telemetry as well as a cardiac rule out. 

Her white count was 12 and her hematocrit was 42.  BUN 29 and

creatinine 1.2.  The d-dimer was negative.  Troponin was

negative.  Her chest x-ray was negative.

Main issue is whether his hematologic abnormalities are secondary to infection, presumably immiune-mediated, or whether there is primary hematologic disorder with worrisome WBC/diff. Has clinical bleeding as well as thrombocytopenia.  Lung abnormality may be pneumonia, but given context needs further definition--unlikely bacterial. 



I've asked Dr. Flora Cole to consult.

MASSEY,RAMONA   446-90-33-6                       VISIT DATE: 10/07/69
TIME OF DICTATION:  1 p.m. 
PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
patient is a 63-year-old female who presents to the Zollman Community Clinic Emergency Department from home after the patient 
was found down by her daughter inside her home for an unspecified 
amount of time.  The paramedics and police were called the scene. 
The police were able to force open the door of the home.  The 
patient was found unconscious on the floor, having a generalized 
tonic clonic seizure.  The patient was intubated and given 4 mg of 
Ativan prior to arrival in the Emergency Department with the 
paramedics.  On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient 
was noted to be comatose, intubated, and clearly in acute distress. 
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.  She has had a 
seizure in the past, apparently secondary to hypoglycemia.  She 
also has a history of high blood pressure.  She is on diltiazem, 
lisinopril, and medications for hypercholesterolemia. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 100.6 degrees F., her 
pulse 150, her respiratory rate 12, her blood pressure on arrival 
205/90, and her O2 saturation is 98%.  On physical examination, the 
HEENT examination reveals a normocephalic head with no evidence of 
trauma on examination.  The pupils are equal and round, weakly 
reactive to light.  The pupils are 2 mm.  The fundi cannot be 
visualized.  The neck is supple.  There are no step-offs noted. 
The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart has 
normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmur.  The abdomen is 
protuberant, but soft and non-tender, without guarding, rebound, 
masses, or organomegaly.  The extremities are grossly within normal 
limits.  Grossly, there is no posturing; there are no Babinskis; 
the reflexes are about 1+ bilaterally. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The head CT is noted to be negative.  The 
EKG reveals ST elevations in III and possibly aVF.  The heart rate 
is approximately 130.  The chest x-ray shows proper tube placement. 
The troponin I is 2.2, and is in the process of being repeated. 
The glucose is 174, the BUN 57, the creatinine 5.8, the sodium 137, 
the potassium 5.3, the chloride 101, the CO2 18.  The CK is noted 
to be 920, and the CK-MB is 2.6%.  The toxicology screen is 
negative.  The troponin I again is 2.2.  The urine toxicology is 
also noted to be negative.  The white count is 14, the hemoglobin 
11, the hematocrit 36, and the platelet count 350.  The urinalysis 
shows 3+ blood.  There are only 1-3 WBCs in the urine. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:   The plan is to admit the patient 
to the Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and evaluation.  An 
LP will be done in the Emergency Department, and following the LP, 
the patient will be sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  The diagnostic impression in the Emergency 
Department is seizure and coma of undetermined etiology. 
DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  The patient will 
be admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following her lumbar 
puncture.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Greenwood comes in to urgent care clinic for
hives after taking Keflex.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is a 47-year-old woman with
chronic hydradenitis suppurativa since the age of 18 in her left
axilla and her groin.  She has been to the emergency room
multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.  She has
been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and
dicloxacillin.  She is planning to have her disease surgically
managed in the next few months.  She most recently presented to
the emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage
of her hydradenitis in her groin.  She was given a prescription
of Keflex.  Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed
itching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives.  She
denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of
consciousness.  She called the emergency room and was instructed
to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic
reaction.  So now, she is here for follow up from that.  She said
shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and
itchiness have improved very quickly.  She is still complaining
of purulent drainage around her groin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.

MEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.  She
gets hives from both.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.  Her bilateral
groins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some
purulent drainage.  There is no fluctuance that I could feel.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.  Given the
recent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a
different antibiotic.  She has been on dicloxacillin in the past
with good result.  Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin
compared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for
now.  If this does not work, I think one should consider
clindamycin for treatment.  I will go ahead and give her 14 days
worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D. if
she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.  I also gave
her 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her
prescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day.  She should see her
PCP in two weeks.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS / CARDIOLOGY DATA:

No acute ischemic changes, no signif change from previous.  Pos. PVC.  Pos. PVC and bigeminy on telemetry.



RADIOLOGY:

Lower extremity dopplers neg. for DVT.

Plain films of lower extremities neg. for gas or osteal elevation.





IMPRESSION: 50 yo man with chronic venous stasis and exacerbation of RLE skin breakdown, left shift in WBCs, and chest pain with dysrhythmia.



PLAN:

1.	Cellulitis:  Despite DM and venous stasis, lesion that the patient has is very superficial, and therefore need not be treated as a diabetic ulcer, requiring coverage for pseudomonas and anaerobes.  This is rather a simple cellulitis, and may be treated with Ancef.  Consult wound care nurse to recommend appropriate dressings and care of wound.  Consider c/s surgery for unaboots.  No debridement necessary.  Send blood cx - monitor for bloodstream seeding.  Consider MRI of LE to r/o osteomyelitis, however, doubt such a shallow ulceration could cause it.

2.	Chest pain with bigeminy and PVCs:  Rule out for MI by enzymes x3, as ?new dysrhythmia may signify ?myocardial irritation/damage.  Monitor EKG and telemetry.  If ruled out, consider inpt vs. outpt adenoside mibi.  Check lipid panel to further elucidate CAD risk, possibly start a statin.

3.	Deconditioning/SOB:  Consult PT/OT to assist with mobility and exercise tolerance.  

4.	Prophylaxis:  Fragmin.  Counsel re: weight loss.

RIVERS,KARSTEN   957-18-08-4                    VISIT DATE: 02/07/66

The patient was seen and examined by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 39-year-old man with a 

history of hypertension and diabetes, whose social history is 

unremarkable, who has a negative review of systems, and who has no 

history of any surgical procedures.  He presents with a burn on the 

right side of the neck.  He presents to the emergency department 

with a minor amount of redness on the right side of the neck and 

minor soft tissue swelling.  The trachea is midline.  The uvula is 

midline.  There is no airway compromise.  There are no airway 

complaints.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  No voice change.  The airway is patent and 

intact.  The lungs are clear, with no wheezes.  The examination 

shows a first-degree burn of the right side of the neck, with no 

blistering and no breakage of the skin.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient received a tetanus shot 

and was seen by the Burn Service.  He was dressed with Bacitracin 

and discharged home.  He was to follow up in 48 hours just for a 

recheck.  The Burn Service essentially signed off on him, with no 

need for follow-up, but given this was his neck and only 

first-degree, I asked him to return here for follow-up.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  First-degree burn of the right side of the neck.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  He is discharged 

with Bacitracin ointment and analgesics, and is to follow up in 48 

hours.  The patient's condition on discharge is stable.

I have examined and treated the patient myself as well as reviewed 

and confirmed the resident's detailed documentation.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this 68-year-old woman 

with a history of diabetes and a past history of ulcers on the 

right foot complains of increased pain on the right leg over the 

past three days.  It was worse yesterday.  It was slightly better 

today.  She has not really been able to get out of bed secondary to 

the pain, whereas she is usually very active.  She denies fever, 

chills, palpitations, and diarrhea.  She has not recently checked 

her blood sugar.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, dementia, 

chronic ulcer of left great toe.  Past surgical history:  

Hysterectomy in the distant past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 70, 

respirations 18.  Blood pressure was initially 241/90.  HEENT:  

Within normal limits.  NECK:  Within normal limits.  LUNGS:  Within 

normal limits.  HEART:  Normal except for a 3/6 systolic ejection 

murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal pulses 

throughout except that most of the pulses are heard only by 

Doppler, and on the left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses 

there is no Doppler pulse available.  The lower extremities are 

both cool and somewhat modeled to the mid thigh.  Toes are somewhat 

dusky.  There is a 5 x 5-mm shallow ulcer on the medial aspect of 

the left great toe.  

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The Orthopedic Service was 

consulted and did AVIs and PVRs which indicated an ischemic lower 

extremity with a question of aortoiliac disease versus thrombus.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Orthopedic Service.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Arterial insufficiency.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

being admitted to the Orthopedic Service, is not being heparinized 

at present; and a decision of angiography or MRA will be 

considered.  The patient was admitted to the hospital in stable 

condition.

Patient Name: FLAHERTY, XAVIER;  MRN: 1935081
Dictated on: 10/23/2120 by ROSITA KO, M.D. 

 
The patient is a 72-year-old male, paraplegic, referred for evaluation of recurrent bladder infections.  The patient has persistent presence of bacteria in his urine and there is a concern that he might have a persistent source of infection.  The patient denies fevers, chills, sweats, decrease in energy, loss of appetite, pain in the lower abdomen or penile discharge.  He reports there is some soreness around the meatus, which he attributes to self-catheterizing he is required to do 3 times a day.  He is well educated in terms of cleaning around the side and the appropriate way to do self-catheterization.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, paraplegia secondary to unclear disk problems in 2107, right hip ulcer with trochanteric osteomyelitis in December 2118, treated with Unasyn x6 weeks and debridement and surgical flap, sacral decubiti in 2119 treated with Unasyn x6 weeks, local debridement healing by secondary intention.  No history of kidney stones.   
SOCIAL:  Ex-tobacco use 2-3 packs per day, quit 25 years. Alcohol prior heavy use, quit 25 years.  Lives alone.  Prior work included Heavy-Duty Equipment Mechanic, Ironworker, as well as Electric Appliance Servicer.  
 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  Blood pressure medication, name unknown. Metformin.  Note, patient had been on Bactrim prophylaxis over the spring.   
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 150/100, heart rate 100, temperature 97.9.  In general, vigorous, well-appearing man in wheelchair.  Awake and alert.  HEENT, sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Neck supple.  No significant lymphadenopathy.  Chest, clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen benign.  Extremities, warm and well perfused.  No edema.  
 
IMPRESSION:  Presence of bacteria in static urine within the bladder is not necessarily diagnostic as infection given patient's lack of symptoms and likely reflects colonization.   
PLAN:  Would not treat patient with antibiotics unless he develops signs or symptoms of infection such as fevers, chills, sweats, elevated white blood cell count, pain in the suprapubic area or decreased energy.

RE:  Xavier Olive

Dear Michael,

Mr. Xavier Olive presents for evaluation, thanks for your
referral.  As you recall he is a 71-year-old gentleman who is
status post angioplasty on the left for high-grade stenotic
lesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the
popliteal artery on the left.  The patient presents now for
further evaluation of his ""claudication symptoms"".

The patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms,
there are about equivalent in nature.  He has very minimal low
back pain.  He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to
be associated with some abnormal gait.  He states on a bad day
its about a 9/10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as
high as 8-9/10.  The episodes are almost daily and are brought on
by things like walking.  He can walk less than one block at which
point he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow
shuffling and occasionally falling.  When he is having severe
symptoms he notes his legs to be weak.  He denies any bowel or
bladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic
UTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He has very
little back pain associated with his symptomatology.  He has had
no physical therapy to date and no spinal injections.  He
describes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he
states it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension.
 Years ago he stated he was in excellent health.  His weight is
steady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss.  He
doesn't smoke and drinks socially.  Quit smoking 33 years ago. 
He does not think he will ever be pain free.

Review of Systems:  Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic
and he has been for the past couple of years.  He has difficulty
with sleep.  He has a balance problem and also has benign
prostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection,
for this he takes Cardura.  He has a history of high blood
pressure.  Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality.  No
respiratory malfunction.  He has had surgery for something ""in
his colon"" he has also had a bypass surgery.  He is on Plavix and
aspirin.

Physical Examination:  Shows that he is solid built, healthy
appearing male.  He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left
side his T band seems to be slightly weak.  Single toe raises
show that the right leg is stronger than the left leg.  He has no
tenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs.  He has
negative Trendelenburg bilaterally.  Forward flexion allows him
to get to the patella.  Extension is pain free and passive
hyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms.

Motor testing is normal in his lower extremities.  Sensory is
symmetric.  He has negative straight leg raises.  He has no
palpable pulses.  He is hairless in his lower extremities.  He
had no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman's suggesting
that he is not myelopathic despite his ""balance abnormality"".

He is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes,
and for his gastroesophageal reflux.

Personal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating
with, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in
his iliac artery on the right.  CT scan shows lumbosacral facet
hypertrophy.

At this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative
disk disease.  I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to
see me after that.

Thanks for the referral.

Reason for Visit	

Mr. Whitehead is here for follow-up of multiple issues.



Problems	  

LOW BACK PAIN	      

he had prolonged discogenic back pain in 1/2070 and could not get appt with NAMG orthopedic/back surgeon and went to Montreal Medical Center.  He underwent L4/5 lamenictomy in 2/2070.  He has persistent right-lower back pain and has seen Dr. Conley.  A myleogram done on 8/5/71 showed degenerative disc disease with moderate spinal stenosis at L4/5.  He will be seeing Dr. Sheehan.  Mr. Whitehead is contemplating surgery as he cannot walk without pain.

Elevated blood sugar	      

BS was 191 in 11/1/69 and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical.  He has been on meds for NIDDM.  He could not tolerate high dose of glucophage and is now seeing endocrine.  His HBA1c was 7.5 in 6/71 on glyburide 5 mg bid and glucophage 500 mg qd.  He has regular optho exam and is on zestoretic.  Little rationale to check for microalbuminuria as he is already on ace-inh.  His lipids are controlled with diet and lipitor.

To see endocrine in 9/71.



hyperlipidemia	      

now on lipitor 40 mg qhs.  He has NIDDM and HTN.  His lipid profile from 4/71 showed a LDL of 103.  LFT were normal.  COntinue med.

HYPERTENSION	      

Now on zestoretic 20/25 qd + atenolol 50 mg qd.  He has significant white coat component.  It is again high at 170/80 in left arm.  His BP reading in hospital for myelogram this week was 130/80.  No change.



h/o PROSTATITIS	      

had recurring prostatitis sx's and saw Dr. Dotson.  Cystoscopy in 1/2070 was normal.  He is on flomax 0.4 mg qd and doing better.  His PSA was 2.9 in 8/69 and 3.2 in 8/70.  To see Dr. Dotson soon.



Neurological symptoms	      

he reports having intolerance to bright lights, tingling in his mid anterior abdomen and chest as well as numbness in his left middle three digits with some neck discomfort.  His MRI of his LS spine done at Montreal Medical in early 2070 evidently showed (by his report) no cord abnormalities.  His sx's sound like left-sided cervical radiculopathy but his visual and abdominal sx's makes me concerned about  systemic demyelinating conditions.  Will check TSH, B12 and have him see Dr. Conley. [08/28/70]



TSH and B12 levels were normal.  His sx's in his eyes and abdomen have essentially resolved.  He still has some cervical radiculopathy syptoms.  He will see Dr. Conley (yet to do so). [01/21/71]



still did not see Dr. Conley.  He now has right neck pain.  His left sided numbness has resolved.  Again referred him to Dr. Conley.  He likely has cervical radiculopathy. [04/09/71]



c-spine MRI ordered by Dr. Conley showed mutliple levels of spondylothis.

RE:  		Isabelle Y. Quick

ATCH: 		655-75-45



Dear Harry and Yair:



My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.  As you know, she is just 52 years of age.  Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.  She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.  She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.  She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.  On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.  This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.  In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.  There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.  She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.  By last spring, i.e. a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.  She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.  Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.  Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.  Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (??? length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.  Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.  She has sought an opinion here in this regard.  She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.  On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.  Pulse was 70 and regular.  Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.  She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.  There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.  She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.



This is of course a very unhappy situation.  Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.  However I am not absolutely ruling this out.  I would suggest the following.  Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.  Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.  She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.  If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.  I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.  My thanks once again.  With every best wish.



Sincerely,





Daniel W. Iniguez, M.D.

(1)	Diabetes mellitus: Went on cruise.  Ate frequently but watched portions.  Apparently patient checks blood sugars between 3:00 and 3:00 and when she has shakiness.  She was under the impression that after lunch she had to fast for three hours prior to checking sugar, at which point notes low blood sugars in the 50's to 70's with shakiness, for which she takes a handful of raisins.  Generally eats breakfast at 8:30, lunch 12:00 or 12:30, supper at 5:30.  Snacks in the evening, always apple and yogurt.  Most recently, additionally popcorn and saltine crackers, occasional pretzels.  After takes raisins, shakiness of hypoglycemic symptoms resolve.  While on cruise, patient found that she could actually walk more than she thought she could.  Since she has been home, has not been walking routinely.

(2)	HTN: No chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations.  

(3)	Back pain/lower extremity pain.  States taking glucosamine chondroitin.  Over the last two or three months, feels that it is helping with decreased pain.  Also has been seen at physical therapy again.  Feels that this is helping.



PE:	Weight down 2 pounds!.  Blood pressure, right arm: 126/68.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac: Regular rhythm at 66, no murmur or gallop.  



A/P:	(1)	Diabetes mellitus: Somewhat better control with mildly elevated morning sugars.  Have asked patient to decrease popcorn and/or crackers at h.s.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Stroke.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old right-handed
woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and
hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the Neurology Service on
06/18/2067 with right-arm weakness and difficulty speaking.  She
presented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming
normal.  Her initial NI stroke scale was 11.  She was admitted to
the Neurology Service for a stroke workup.  Her imaging studies
showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head
of the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA
in addition to a left ICA occlusion.  She was taken to angiogram
for interventional neuroradiology.  She had an angiogram. 
Radiology felt they were unable to access the
cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was
admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and
hypertensive therapy.  She remained stable anti-coagulated on
heparin.  During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted
to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to
be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to
remain anti-coagulated.  She was discharged to rehab and
subsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.  At home, she
had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been
feeling O.K.  VNA sees her once a week.  At rehab, for unclear
reasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the
discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was
done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is
unaware of any such problems.  She continues to get PT and
occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory
remains poor.  According to the family member and her daughter
who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues
to have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and
decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able
to communicate well with her.  Since her discharge, she has not
had any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual
changes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,
claudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,
heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,
rashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,
or bleeding problems.  Review of neurological systems as above.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated
cholesterol.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Zoloft, Zocor, and Captopril.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in Castle Rock with her son. 
No history of tobacco or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  A sister had a stroke.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was 150/80, her heart
rate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.  General:  Pleasant woman in
no acute distress.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera
anicteric, and oropharynx is clear.  There is no thyromegaly. 
Neck:  Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.  Heart:  Regular rate
and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:  Has good
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Skin:  No rashes
or ulcers.  Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the
interpreter):  She is alert and oriented.  She is attentive.  She
is non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.  She has
decreased naming and decreased comprehension.  She does not have
any neglect or apraxia.  Registration is 3/4.  Short-term memory
is 0/4 in 5 minutes.  Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters.
 Fundi are normal.  Extraocular movements are intact with
nystagmus.  Visual fields are full to confrontation.  She has a
right facial droop.  Facial sensation is intact.  Hearing is
normal.  Motor exam:  There is increased muscle tone on the right
arm and leg.  She has strength on the left is normal.  On the
right, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on the
left on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.  She
reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm. 
There is no ataxia on the left.  Gait is slow, walks with a cane,
and so conducts the right leg.  Her reflexes are brisker on the
right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.  

IMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any
acute stroke or hemorrhage.  On the CT, there was a question of a
left MI cutoff.  CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA
stenosis with minimal distal interflow.  MRI of the brain showed
a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of
the caudate basal ganglia.  She has had mild to moderate chronic
small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.  Echo showed a normal
EF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.  

IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant
vascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory
infarct.  On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both
comprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.  It
is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her
stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
during her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from
anti-coagulation therapy.  I have asked her to get a follow up
PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are
any contraindications to anti-coagulation.  If there are no such
contraindications, she should restart on warfarin.  In addition,
her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask
her to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d. and to maintain a
blood pressure diary.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg
t.i.d.
2.  Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.
3.  Continue risk factor modification with the management of
blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.
4.  PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab
stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications
per the PCP.
5.  Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait
training and language rehab.
6.  Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new
problems.

More than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education
and counseling.

EDVISIT^06129040^MACK, ROSE^08/16/92^GRAHAM, ANGELA

This patient's visit was shared with PA, Quiring.  I also

personally interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female with

past medical history of type 1 diabetes, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation of an

infected left heel ulcer.  The patient is status post bypass

grafting in her lower extremities and skin grafting of a

nonhealing ulcer on her right heel.  Since that time, she has

developed a chronic nonhealing ulcer on the left heel, which has

been followed closely by VNA.  Today, she was seen by her VNA who

was very concerned about redness and swelling of her left foot

with redness that extended underneath the plantar surface of the

foot and over the dorsal surface and concern for infection of

this ulcer.  The patient has minimal sensation in the left foot. 

She states sometimes she can feel a pressure sensation.  She does

have some pain when she tries to weightbear, has not noted any

fevers, has noted some chills and states that her fingerstick

earlier today was elevated.  She denies any abdominal pain,

nausea, or vomiting.  She does note that her foot does appear to

be somewhat slightly more swollen but has not noticed redness up

until today.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for hypothyroidism, type 1

diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease with a nonhealing

diabetic foot ulcers.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She is status post femoral bypass

grafting, thyroidectomy, skin grafting for nonhealing wounds, and

right foot debridement in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She smoked in the past, does not drink.  She

lives with family, is followed by a VNA, and is not working.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for diabetes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems reviewed and otherwise

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin.

ALLERGIES:  She has an allergy to codeine, aspirin, erythromycin,

oxycodone, and sulfa.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 105,

respirations 16, blood pressure 117/70, and O2 saturations are

100% on room air.  The patient is awake, alert, frail, and thin

female.  She is in no respiratory distress.  Her head examination

is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Her conjunctivae are slightly

pale.  She has moist mucous membranes.  The airway is patent. 

Her neck is supple with full range of motion without any pain. 

The trachea is midline.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation

bilaterally with equal breath sounds.  No respiratory distress,

no accessory muscle use, and no chest wall tenderness.  Her

cardiac examination is tachycardic and regular at about 100 with

a 3/6 systolic murmur.  Her abdomen is nondistended, soft, and

nontender.  No guarding and no peritoneal signs.  Her skin is

remarkable for healing superficial ulcers on the right heel.  On

the left heel, she has a superficial ulcer with a dark eschar,

which is approximately 4 x 4 cm in diameter.  There is no

purulent discharge around the area; however, the skin of the left

foot is fairly violaceous and warm on the plantar surface of the

foot surrounding the ulcer extending up the lateral aspect of the

foot to the anterior aspect of the left ankle was demarcated in

the Emergency Department.  There is no other break in the skin

visualized.  Her back is nontender with full range of motion. 

Extremities are remarkable for lower extremity atrophy.  She does

have 1+ edema of both feet.  She has minimal sensation on

palpation of her feet with no obvious tenderness on palpation

over her left foot.  Her pulses are trace.  She is alert and

oriented x3, has a depressed affect.  See the PA note for

remainder of the details of the physical examination.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient had IV access

initiated.  Laboratory studies were sent including blood

cultures.  She was started on IV antibiotics, vancomycin, and

gentamicin and was consulted to Vascular Surgery.  Her feet

remained elevated.  She had a plain x-ray performed of her foot,

which showed no obvious evidence of osteomyelitis and no

subcutaneous gas.  Her laboratory studies are remarkable for

hyperglycemia and she was started on IV fluids.

DISPOSITION:  She is admitted to Surgery.

DIAGNOSIS:  Left foot, nonhealing ulcer with left foot

cellulitis, and peripheral vascular disease.

See the note for details.

Impression: 48 yo man with CF, CF-induced DM, and HTN, who presented to an outside hospital with focal neuro changes of unclear etiology, but concerning for a CVA.  



Recommendations: 

1.	Neuro: Would get a brain MRI/MRA to further evaluate.  After the MRI is done, would get a neurology consult in the morning.  Continue ASA, BP control in the meantime.  Patient may need a repeat LP depending on neuro consult recs.

2.	Pulm: CF appears stable. Would continue his outpatient Advair, albuterol, azithro.

3.	GI: continue enzymes, vitamins. High calorie, high protein CF diet.

4.	Endo: monitor blood glucose.

Lung Transplant Attending Note:



I have seen and examined the patient with Dr. Titus and I agree with her evaluation and plan as outlined above.  Mr. Aguilar is a 48 yo man with h/o CF with mild pulmonary disease, who presented to an OSH on 1/26 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias, followed by a loss of left visual field, diplopia, and left sided weakness.  The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness.  The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein.  Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms, as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam.  Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis, otherwise neurologic exam non-focal.  Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles.  DDX for above includes ischemic process, though symptoms appear to be multi-focal, vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process.  Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms, or meningeal process.  We plan to obtain CNS MRI, neuro consult.  Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up.  Continue maintenance medications for CF.

cystoscopy

Patient was placed in the supine  position and prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Lidocaine jelly was inserted into the meatus for local anaesthesia.  A flexible cystoscope was inserted into the meatus.  The urethra was without lesions.  The lateral lobes of the prostate coapted at the midline.  The stent was identified and using alligator forceps the distal portion was grasped.  It was removed intact.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was discharged from the clinic after receiving ciprofloxacin.



Laboratory Values:

An independent review of a urinalysis shows:

                          No WBC's

	Findings:

	There is a left ureteral stent.  Tiny residual stones seen on

	prior CT are not identified on this KUB.The bowel gas pattern is

	nonobstructive.      The bones are unremarkable in appearance. The

	visualized lung bases are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

	LEFT URETERAL STENT.  NO ABNORMAL CALCIFICATIONS IDENTIFIED.

		

	

Impression:  50 yo male treated for a 1.1 cm symptomatic left renal stone.   His post-operative KUB does not show any calcifications.  The stent was removed intact without difficulty.   He is to have a follow up CT in June with and without contrast for further evaluation of a renal lesion seen on a previous CT scan.  He did have a post-operative CT that showed a subcapsular hematoma for which his blood pressure will be followed.   That study also showed the stone which is no longer visualized on todays KUB.  The imaging in June will again assess his stone burden.

        

Plan:

                                              5-31-71

 

 

HPI: Ms. Xian is a 74-year-old female who presented to clinic this 

evening for follow up of her diabetes. Patient was last seen in clinic in 

11-70 after which time she left for Ghana for the past six months. She 

returned this past Friday but has since run out of insulin. She states 

that she has been feeling well and has not had any problems but does not 

know the amount of insulin that she has been taking. It has been 

administered to her by a friend in Ghana. Our records show that when 

she left Ghana she was on a 70/30 of Humulin, 20 units per day and 

also 600mg of Rezulin and 20mg q.d. of Lipitor.

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems is positive for insulin dependent 

diabetes mellitus but other than that Ms. Xian is a fairly healthy woman. 

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam this evening her pulse is 80. Blood 

pressure was 152/80 in her left arm. Blood sugar was 262. It should be 

noted that she has not had any insulin since Sunday. Her weight was 116 1/2 

which reflects a 1/2 lb. weight loss since 11-70. Tonight her heart had a 

regular rate and rhythm at 80. Her neck veins were flat. Her lungs were 

clear to auscultation bilaterally and there was no evidence of peripheral 

edema. 

 

ASSESSMENT: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 

 

PLAN: LFTs, A1C, basic panel this evening. Glucotrol 10mg dispense No. 60 

with 1 refill b.i.d. A VNA referral for medication management and patient 

was instructed to return to the clinic on Saturday 6-05 for repeat blood 

sugar and also to bring her glucometer at that time so that it could be 

calibrated correctly.

						RE:  Tyler Pearson

					                    WMC#727-19-02



Dear Doctor Trejo:



I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Tyler Pearson, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here today.  As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia.  He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint.  He has had no focal, motor, sensory deficits, and no amaurosis fugax.  A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time.  



Assessment and plan:  Overall, I am extremely pleased with Mr. Pearson's outcome given his high risk pulmonary status.  It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months' time with a repeat carotid duplex examination.  I would be happy to assist in the management of this or any of your other patients as you deem necessary in the future.  Thank you again for allowing me to assist in his care.  If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact either myself or one of my partners directly.



						Sincerely,







						Steven E. Land, M.D.

RE:		Ordonez, Yamilex
SNH#:	008-37-16

September 28, 2085

Reason for visit:  This is an initial visit on September 28th, 2085.  Yamilex is a 68-year-old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2083.  

In 2083 Mrs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness.  She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke.  She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol.  

Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide.  Triamterene was added.  Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure.  Of note, she was only mildly orthostatic at that time.  She also had an E. coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters.   

Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline/phosphatase.  She had had a hemoglobin A1C of 6% tested in 2083.  

Yamilex is generally doing well.  She has no particular complaints.  She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy.  She has had no chest pains, shortness of breath, alterations in her bowel or bladder habits.  

Medications:  Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 3.75 q.d. for her history of vertebral artery stenosis and atenolol 75 q.d.  

Physical examination:  Blood pressure was 170/90.  Heart rate was 82 and regular.  The HEENT examination was unremarkable.  Neck was supple without adenopathy.  There were 2+ carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits.  Chest was clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam showed an S4 gallop.  Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema.  Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2+ in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes.  Finger-nose-finger was intact, Romberg was intact, and gait was stable with a narrow base.  

Assessment and plan: 

1.	Hypertension.  Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled.  She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension.  I will start her on 5 mg. of Zestril in addition to her standing 75 of atenolol.  

2.	Neurologic.  Mrs. Ordonez is stable status post her stroke.  She will continue on Coumadin.  I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time.  

3.	Primary care issues.  Mrs. Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2083 of 210.  I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke.  I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past.  

	I have also started Mrs. Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 800 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr. Quesenberry.  I will see Mrs. Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril.

The patient was seen with Richard Quesenberry, M.D.

GI Fellow Consult Note 



Pt: Frantz, Nicole

MRN: 236-07-19

Date of note: 2/10/81 at 12:20pm

Reason for consult: nausea and epigastric pain

Referring MD: Dr. 

ID/CC:  52yoF with DM s/p recent cholecystectomy for nausea here with recurrent nausea/vomiting

HPI:   Pt with DM presenting with 6 weeks of N/V, beginning on 12/26/80 when she had green emesis, then abdominal pain.  Was seen in ED at OSH and sent home.  She continued to vomit, went to another hospital where she stayed for a week, and had a cholecystectomy.  She felt better at home for 4 days after discharge, but had recurrent vomiting, back to ED, admitted again and discharged after a week-long stay.  She now comes to PSH after four episodes of emesis yesterday.

	Pt reports intermittent periumbilical pain, which worsens right before a bout of emesis, then dies down after the emesis.  Pain does not radiate; pt not able to characterize frequency, duration, or quality of the pain.  No obvious relationship between pain and PO intake.

	In between episodes of vomiting, she feels increased amount of secretions in her mouth that she has to spit out.  Denies any dysphagia or odynophagia.  No melena or hematochezia.  Had had constipation, which resolved with laxatives, more recently having 2 BMs/day.

	She does not recall the workup at OSH but thinks she may have had EGD and colonoscopy already, which she reports did not show any abnormality.



ROS:  no fever or night sweats.  No odynophagia or dysphagia.  No rash.  No CP, SOB, LE edema.  Appetite was good and no weight changes before 12/26/80; since then, she is afraid to eat and has lost weight and feels    weak

Abd CT:  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys

	are unremarkable on this unenhanced CT.

	There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without CT evidence

	of diverticulitis.  There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.

	There is a segment of terminal ileum demonstrates thickened wall.

	No significant surrounding inflammatory change.  There is

	questionable thickening of the gastric and proximal duodenal wall

	which may possibly be due to under distention.  There is no

	evidence of free air.

	There is no retroperitoneal, mesenteric or inguinal

	lymphadenopathy. 

A/P:     52yoF with DM with six weeks of recurrent green emesis and periumbilical pain without abdominal distention or KUB or CT signs of obstruction.  Question of TI thickening and gastric thickening (but may appear that way only due to underdistention).  As per pt, she has had EGD and colonoscopy at OSH already.  Would suggest obtaining records from Fairview-Southdale Hospital first before decision regarding repeat w/u here.  Workup may entail gastric emptying scan to assess for gastroparesis, EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate for malignancy or IBD, brain imaging to r/o CNS process.  Can continue to try Reglan 10mg up to QID.



Will staff with Dr. Otis Aguilera later today.

                     SLHC EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

DO,TANYA V   639-25-21-7                    VISIT DATE: 11/10/04

The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation were 

reviewed by me; and I concur.  In addition, I personally 

interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 76-year-old female with 

a history of type 2 diabetes on Glucophage with a history of 

neuropathy who presents complaining of right foot pain, swelling, 

and redness.  The patient had a callus shaved off the plantar 

aspect of her foot approximately three weeks ago.  She noticed some 

aching pain in the area of her foot over the last several days and 

then in the last 24 to 48 hours has developed swelling and redness 

of her foot with inability to ambulate secondary to severe pain.  

She has had loss of appetite, but she denies any fever or 

generalized malaise.  She denies any leg swelling.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for arthritis, type 2 diabetes, a 

history of vasculitis, history of diabetic neuropathy, and history 

of cataracts.  Her surgical history is positive for right total hip 

replacement, bilateral knee replacements, laminectomy in the back 

with fusion with rods, and a history of a colostomy with reversal.  

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  She has smoked in the past.  

She does not drink.  She is a retired Paralegal, lives alone.  She 

has a family history of diabetes.  Please see resident note for the 

remainder of the details of the patient's history including a long 

list of medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.0, pulse 94, 

respirations 18, blood pressure 137/50.  Oxygen saturation is 92% 

on room air.  The patient is an awake, alert, well-developed 

female, pleasant, talkative, in no acute distress.  EXTREMITIES: 

Her examination is most remarkable for the right lower extremity 

which shows edema and redness over the dorsum of her right foot.  

This extends down over the metatarsophalangeal joints and down 

underneath the plantar aspect of her foot over the heads of the 

metatarsals and the bases of the toes.  On the plantar aspect of 

the foot below the third toe, there is an area of skin change which 

is very tender.  There is a blanching yellow appearance that is 

very firm.  It is not fluctuant.  There is no drainage.  It appears 

to be the area where the callus was shaved.  The remainder of the 

foot is slightly firm, erythematous, and tender.  Her pulses are 

1+.  She has good capillary refill, and light touch is intact.  Her 

calf is soft and nontender.  Please see the resident note for the 

remainder of the details of the physical examination.  Evaluation 

of this patient in the Emergency Department included laboratory 

studies.  This is a diabetic patient with foot cellulitis secondary 

to a wound on the plantar aspect of her foot.  Of note, she also is 

exposed to pool water as she swims daily.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  She had laboratory studies performed which 

show a white blood cell count of 14,000; hematocrit 31.5; platelets 

348.  Her electrolytes including glucose are pending at the time of 

this dictation.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  IV access was obtained, and the 

patient was treated with IV antibiotics of Levaquin and 

Clindamycin.  

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Right foot cellulitis.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Her primary care 

physician, Dr. Keane, who saw her prior to her arrival in the 

Emergency Department was contacted.  The patient is being admitted 

to the General Medical Service.  Please see the resident note for 

the remainder of the details of the patient's visit.
