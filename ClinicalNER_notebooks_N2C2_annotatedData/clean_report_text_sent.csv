86,DHN   DATE OF BIRTH
87,CURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE
88,Dear Vicente
89,Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez a yearold male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing as well as a history of difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.
90,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
91,As you already know Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance as well as increased early morning awakenings has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year.
92,He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a yearold son and a yearold daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer.
93,In particular Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.
94,He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses.
95,He is unaware of a restless lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep.
96,He denies a history of a  night owl personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties.
97,He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.
98,Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on  during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of hour particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas with equal distribution during nonREM and stage REM sleep and with associated O desaturation Nadir of
99,The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas.
100,In addition loud snoring was noted.
101,There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of  and a short sleep onset latency of  minutes.
102,There was a predominance of light nonREM stages III sleep and a concomitant inability to achieve significant slowwave or stage REM sleep.
103,There was also alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep evident during the initial sleep study.
104,In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.
105,The patient underwent a CPAP titration on  also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas respiratory disturbance index equals hour with CPAP titrations between  cm.
106,Sleep efficiency improved to  a short sleep onset latency was also noted  minutes.
107,There was once again an increased predominance of light nonREM stage III sleep with concomitant inability to achieve sustained slow wave sleep.
108,Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration at  cm of water pressure and with various CPAP mask modifications including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt Breeze supportive head gear with nasal pillows.
109,The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general.
110,As a result he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.
111,Of particular note and exacerbation of the past year the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings averaging  in number with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at  p.m. the patient describes one awakening at  p.m. and the second awakening at  a.m. of unclear causative etiology.
112,The patient then might awaken at  a.m. and be ready for the day.
113,If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at  a.m.
114,The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes coronary artery disease depressive disorder as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.

137,ALLERGIESADVERSE REACTIONS
138,The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.
139,SOCIAL HISTORY
140,The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage.
141,He has lost  pounds over the past several years.
142,His current weight is  pounds.
143,He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.
144,On examination the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of  seated left arm respiratory rate .
145,HEENT EXAMINATION Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.
146,The patient appears awake alert with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact.
147,He is presently wearing dental braces.
148,No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.
149,No focal sensory motor or neurologic deficits are noted.
150,No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence.
151,The routine gait appears to be normal based without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.
152,No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.
153,No acute evidence of microsleeps are noted.
154,IMPRESSION   .
155,Sleep stagearrousal dysfunction .
156,Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of lightened sleep pattern with increased predominance of nonREM stages  sleep and with the presence of alpha intrusions and alpha delta component to deeper sleep.
157,These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage.
158,.
159,Sleep disordered breathing As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea.
160,The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with its usage despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures  cm.
161,In addition he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask including the Mallinckrodt Breeze supportive head gear with nasal pillows and with limited success.
162,One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future and if so utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to tangled tubing at night and issues referable to nasal face mask usage as noted above.
163,.
164,Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance
165,The patient describes at least  early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance thereby compounding his current sleep problem.
166,While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation i.e. in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.
167,PLAN   .
168,In the short course in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy
169,mg tablets utilizing one to two tablets p.o.
170,q. h.s.
171,PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.
172,.
173,The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than  times per week in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.
174,.
175,The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence gastric upset loose stools diarrhea and or cardiac palpitations.
176,Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms.
177,If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however I might consider supplemental O therapy at night and with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated endtidal CO monitoring as well.
178,.
179,In the meantime the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.
180,.
181,The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation in approximately four months time.
182,Once again thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez.
183,I hope this letter finds you well.
184,Sincerely yours
185,Yovani Vergara M.D.

486,She gets as many as three or four  a day.
487,The frequency has however decreased and she is feeling  better and better as she begins to lose some weight.
488,I think  weight loss is going to be critical.
489,She also is less fatigued  as she begins to lose weight.
490,Her hypertension has been under better control.
491,Hydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition  to the atenolol.

520,Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.
521,She has been doing very well.
522,She has been exercising and has lost from   to  pounds.
523,She is feeling very well.
524,Notably Dr. Lu sent her for a followup ETT.
525,He did not find the  first ETT acceptable.
526,The second ETT was grossly positive.
527,As a result  of this I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on  atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide put her on ramipril and a  nitrate.
528,She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of  pain that she was having before when she went up steps.
529,She did have hyperlipidemia.
530,We have put her on Lipitor which has  provided some control.
531,However her HCL is still  and LDL  which  is not an excellent ratio.
532,Nonetheless her CK has been within normal  limits.
533,She also has right shoulder lipoma.
534,This has become apparent since she  lost so much weight.
535,She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have  recommended Dr. Dawson.

553,She is also on one aspirin a day along with  Premarin and Synthroid. .
554,Weight loss.
555,She will continue to exercise.
556,I suspect she is going  to lose more weight.
557,This is excellent. .
558,Coronary artery disease.
559,Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a  cardiac catheterization.
560,It is his opinion and I must concur that  this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.
561,She is going to  delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment  done on this variety of medical issues.

1505,He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.
1506,As we discussed on the phone his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this.
1507,He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.
1508,I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.
1509,The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.
1510,MRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.
1511,The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in .
1512,He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.
1513,The patient will return for a followup visit after the above tests.
1514,Thank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.

1565,They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process.
1566,He does have renal insufficiency but no other abnormalities to suggest MM.
1567,We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out.
1568,Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.
1569,In addition he has a hx of a positive PPD unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically.
1570,Is any of this TB

2502,Assessment
2503,Status post TIA possibly related to AF
2504,Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.
2505,The latter is more likely cause especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT and is proably secondary to glaucoma.
2506,Plan Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
2507,Continue  ASA and coumadin and statin Continued HTN and DM control Will touch base with ophthalmology regarding the left optic neuropathy  Return in  months.

2698,Morgan      Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.
2699,She is a yearold woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than pack years quitting approximately eight years ago.
2700,She suffers from hypertension hyperlipidemia glucose intolerance and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD.
2701,She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine.
2702,She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler.
2703,With these treatments her dyspnea improved but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.
2704,She does report some episodes of chest heaviness which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest which will last for minutes at a time.
2705,These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week.
2706,She was placed on Nexium with some improvement but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes.
2707,To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
2708,This was performed on  and did not show any evidence of PE however there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery.
2709,There was a focal  mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery.
2710,She was then referred to me for further evaluation.
2711,Past medical history     Hypertension.

2739,She denies any significant change in weight.
2740,She has intermittent headaches relieved with Advil.
2741,She reports chronic cough and wheeze which has been improved on prednisone.
2742,She has shortness of breath with exertion but denies exertional chest pain.
2743,No lower extremity edema palpitations or dizzy spells.
2744,She reports her reflux symptoms are improved on her Nexium.
2745,She has no history of stroke no history of anemia.

2764,Assessment and plan     Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension hyperlipidemia a positive family history and heavy tobacco use in the past.
2765,She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy.
2766,Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm.
2767,I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple highrisk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan.
2768,She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.
2769,Plan   .
2770,Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment.
2771,.
2772,Treatment of her emphysema as per your office.

2820,Recs
2821,Recommend retrievable IVC filter.
2822,Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing and that cardiac enzymes BNP and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
2823,Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
2824,Can change to low molecular weight heparin.

2826,Thanks for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient      Earnest Vanwinkle pager
2827,Record date         Mr. Villegas is seen today.
2828,I have not seen him since November.
2829,About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because he was gaining weight.
2830,He does feel that his shoulders are definitely improved.
2831,It is unclear what he is actually taking
2832,but I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension and
2833,Hydroxychloroquine tablet.
2834,He is concerned because of the relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the right.
2835,When he does this he will note that he feels as though he is going to pass out although this has not actually happened.
2836,This only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.
2837,He has no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other cranial complaints.
2838,On examination today BP .
2839,He has no bruits over the carotid.
2840,He has no tenderness in this region either.
2841,He has good peripheral pulses at the arms.
2842,His joint examination is much improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint synovitis.
2843,Clinical Impression     Inflammatory arthritis  possibly RA  with response noted to Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.
2844,He has stopped the Prednisone and I would not restart it yet.
2845,New onset of symptoms suspicious for rightsided carotid disease.
2846,Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.
2847,Patient advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.
2848,He has been taking  aspirin per day prophylaxis longterm and I stressed that he continue to do so.
2849,He will followup with me shortly after the ultrasound study.

3248,Newburgh Street Pinehurst OH
3249,Dear Dr. Law
3250,I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.
3251,As you know he is a yearold gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on  for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.
3252,His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia gastroesophageal reflux disease and asthma.
3253,Prior to his pacemaker placement an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain.
3254,He was able to exercise for  minutes and  seconds.
3255,The test was terminated for  substernal chest pain but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant.
3256,Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished however he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker.
3257,Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ  pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.
3258,His estimated battery longevity is  months.
3259,The atrial impedance is  ohms the ventricular impedance is  ohms.
3260,The Pwave is .
3261,mV.
3262,The Rwave is .
3263,mV.
3264,The threshold in the atrium is .
3265,V at .
3266,mV and the threshold in the ventricle is .
3267,V at .
3268,msec.
3269,In summary Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement.
3270,His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.
3271,There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.
3272,However his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing.
3273,Looking at his heart rate histogram it appears that this sinus rates have varied from  beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal.
3274,I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.
3275,For this reason I have performed a TSH today which is normal however I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated.
3276,I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time.
3277,I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months time and if any issues arise in the interim please do not hesitate to contact me.

3283,Olney OH      Dear Dr. Gordon
3284,I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.
3285,As you know he is a yearold gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on  for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.
3286,His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia gastroesophageal reflux disease and asthma.
3287,Prior to his pacemaker placement an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain.
3288,He was able to exercise for  minutes and  seconds.
3289,The test was terminated for  substernal chest pain but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted.
3290,We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.
3291,He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.
3292,However he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort.
3293,He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.
3294,Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE  pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.
3295,The estimated longevity on the battery life is  months.
3296,The atrial impedance is  ohms and the ventricular impedance is  ohms.
3297,The Pwave in the atrium is .
3298,mV and the Rwave in the ventricle is  mV.
3299,The threshold in the atrium is stable at .
3300,V at . msec and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at .
3301,V at .
3302,msec.
3303,In summary the pacemaker appears to be working quite well.
3304,However Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation.
3305,I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.
3306,In addition I have performed a lead ECG which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia.

3788,History of Present Illness
3789,Mr. Slater comes to the stroke clinic today for an initial visit and second opinion for leftsided weakness starting in .
3790,He was golfing at the time and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes.
3791,The weakness involved the face arm and leg on the left side only.
3792,He went to Gilmore Hospital where they checked his blood pressure and found it to be  per his report.
3793,A CT scan was performed and he was informed that it was normal.
3794,He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA.
3795,He went to the HCH at Easton  days later his BP was still elevated and they started him on clonidine.
3796,They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension but he declined.
3797,No further strokeTIA workup was performed.
3798,He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup.
3799,His weakness has greatly improved but not back to normal.
3800,He has never had sensory changes and no speech difficulties anosognosia neglect or gait instability.
3801,He did have flashing lights in both eyes for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course but none since then.

3853,I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension and to use antiplatelet agents.
3854,I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to
3855,mg per day.
3856,In addition he needs a work up.
3857,I have arranged for him to have CNIS
3858,hour Holter monitoring and TTE with bubble study.
3859,Additionally we should check fasting lipids.
3860,He wishes to have a PCP at FPC and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds.

3894,The best for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA mg per day and continued treatment for his hypertension as per Dr. Tolliver.

3900,DIAGNOSIS Recurrent renal cell carcinoma.
3901,HISTORY Mr. Slater is a delightful and active yearold man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in .
3902,At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy and the final pathology showed a .
3903,cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
3904,Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans.
3905,For the last  years enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy.
3906,A biopsy performed approximately  year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
3907,CT scan was repeated in December of .
3908,This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules.
3909,Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules.
3910,Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer.
3911,His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance.
3912,He has met with Drs.
3913,Eagle and Yzaguirre.
3914,Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well.

4132,Jackson Street La Grulla ME    RE  Branche Earnest MRN
4133,Dear Dr. Xayarath
4134,Your patient Mr. Earnest Branche returned to the office today for a follow up visit.
4135,As you know Mr. Branche underwent a left femoral to posterior tibial bypass one month ago followed by amputation of a gangrenous first toe.
4136,After being discharged from our service he was readmitted to the Medical Service with a severe case of C. difficile colitis.
4137,Ultimately this resolved and he was discharged.
4138,Today he reports that the diarrhea has again resumed and he was placed back on an oral antibiotic yesterday.
4139,He complains of only mild incisional discomfort in his left leg.
4140,On examination there is a strong pulse easily palpated over the left lower extremity bypass graft.
4141,The old right lower extremity bypass graft was also palpable.
4142,The left foot itself is warm.
4143,The great toe incision site however has developed necrotic tissue all along the incision which was sharply debrided to clean margins.
4144,This will now need to be treated as an open wound.

4199,REBranch Earnest MRN
4200,Dear Dr. Xayarath
4201,Your patient Earnest Branch came in the office today for a follow up  visit.
4202,Mr. Branch is now two years out from a right femoral tibial bypass and nine months out from a left femoraltibial  bypass with subsequent transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot  and splitthickness skin grafting.
4203,Over the last several months  he has been undergoing dressing changes to remaining small  superficial open wounds on the dorsum of the left foot.
4204,Over the  last one to two weeks he began to note the development of a new  area of dark skin on the lateral aspect of the left foot and  recently has noted some drainage.
4205,He denies any fevers.
4206,In  addition and of note he complains of recent onset of pain in the  right eye and has an appointment at the Ophthalmology Clinic  immediately following his visit with us.
4207,He last underwent  vascular lab studies in September at which time both lower  extremity bypass grafts were widely patent and without stenoses.
4208,On examination today there are strong easily palpable pulses  over both lower extremity bypass grafts.
4209,The right foot is warm  and without any new ischemic skin changes or lesions.
4210,On  examination of the left foot there is a large area of full thickness skin necrosis on the lateral aspect of the foot where  there had never been any previous open wounds.
4211,This area  encompasses a significant proportion of the lateral aspect of the  foot from the end of the transmetatarsal incision to the proximal  mid foot.
4212,On probing purulent material drains from the margins
4213,and there is obvious significant sepsis.
4214,The foot itself is warm
4215,and there is a good posterior tibial Doppler signal at the ankle.
4216,Unfortunately Mr. Branch has developed a new large wound on the  left foot which likely began as a pressure decubitus ulceration  due to his severe neuropathy.
4217,This is now complicated by  significant local sepsis
4218,and there is a large area of soft tissue  loss on the foot.
4219,He will require urgent admission and operative  debridement today.
4220,In addition given the extent of the problem  it is likely that he will ultimately come to belowknee amputation  in the end.
4221,Immediately following his visit to the Ophthalmology
4222,Clinic he will be admitted to the     REBranch Earnest MRN
4223,Page        hospital with the hopes of performing debridement and drainage  later today.
4224,I will certainly continue to keep you apprised of  his progress.
4225,Sincerely        Luis J. Nicholas M.D.

4478,Umstead Kenneth      MR    Dear Jac   I saw your patient Kenneth Umstead in the Cardiology office today and he seems to be doing very well from a cardiovascular perspective.
4479,Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps.
4480,Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed.
4481,This has been reevaluated and he has been stable.
4482,The fourth polyp will need to be removed at a later time.
4483,At this point his aspirin has been discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests.
4484,His current medications therefore include Lasix
4485,mg per day Metoprolol
4486,mg qd
4487,Nifedipine XL
4488,mg qd.
4489,He is aware of a belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no exertional or other related symptoms.
4490,He is reasonably active but somewhat limited by his claudication.
4491,On exam today he is comfortable with a blood pressure of  a heart rate of  and regular.
4492,Head and neck were unremarkable.
4493,Chest is clear.
4494,Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension at  degrees.
4495,PMI is normal.
4496,S and S are normal with a physiologic split.
4497,There is an S and a IVI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
4498,Abdominal exam was unremarkable.
4499,Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.
4500,His resting lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left intraventricular conduction delay.

4503,Umstead Kenneth July
4504,Page      I think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well.
4505,It would be of value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since .
4506,He had minimal ischemia at that time.
4507,There are no symptoms that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings.
4508,If any problems develop please dont hesitate to contact me.

4520,He feels very comfortable.
4521,His current medications include Metoprolol

4526,Head and neck unremarkable.
4527,Chest is clear.
4528,Cardiac exam is notable for an S and a IVI systolic ejection murmur.
4529,The rest of his exam was unremarkable.
4530,Resting  lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation.
4531,There is a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
4532,I think Mr. Umstead is doing very well.
4533,He would like to have his arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that schedule.
4534,In addition his Metoprolol has been only once a day and if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and more prolonged risk prevention.
4535,I suggest that we increase it to
4536,mg bid.
4537,I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an eye on it.
4538,If it drops too low we can reduce the dose.
4539,He asked that I see him again in about six months for routine reevaluation and I will be happy to do so.
4540,If any problems develop in the interim please do not hesitate to contact me.

4552,Dear Jac   I saw your patient Kenneth Umstead in the Cardiology Office today and he feels he has actually improved.
4553,His primary limitation had been his claudication but he feels that he can walk better now than in the past.
4554,We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure and volumes and these actually were unchanged from a prior study two years ago.
4555,The post volume recordings were normal in each leg.
4556,Systolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg consistent with mild anterior tibialdorsalis pedis disease.
4557,No systolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg.
4558,These were unchanged from January .

4573,There was an S and a IVI systolic ejection murmur at the lower left sternal border.
4574,Abdominal exam was unremarkable.
4575,Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
4576,His resting  lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm left axis deviation and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent with his left anterior hemiblock.
4577,I think Mr. Umstead is doing quite well.
4578,He asked that I see him again in six months for routine reevaluation and I would be happy to do so.
4579,If any problems develop in the interim please dont hesitate to contact me.
4580,Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.

4594,Mr Umstead is an yo M with ho Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia vasculopathy sp CEA known PVD who presents after two weeks of increased lethargy increasing disorientation and visual hallucinations.
4595,Per his wife who acts as his primary caretaker Mr Umstead was in his USOH until about two weeks ago when she began noticing increased lethargy and confusion.
4596,He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own.
4597,This increased in severity over the past  days.
4598,He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits.
4599,He has had no recent fevers chills SOB sudden motor or sensory loss.
4600,No new incontinence.
4601,This history was limited by patient   s inability to cooperate.

4687,ASSESSMENT
4688,PLAN yo M with ho Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia vasculopathic carotid stenosis sp CEA PVD who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy disorientation gait instability and visual hallucinations.
4689,The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.
4690,Given his normal temperature normal CXR and normal UA an infectious etiology is unlikely.
4691,Concern for a strokerelated etiology either embolic or lacunar is unlikely given CT and MRI results.
4692,However microembolic disease may be a possibility.
4693,Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.
4694,As suggested in the CT results normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely.
4695,LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.
4696,One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process perhaps due to hypertension.
4697,A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.
4698,Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation especially in the elderly.
4699,However it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.
4700,Dementia  CXR UA negative.
4701,CTMRI negative for acute embolic events.
4702,Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.

4801,Dear Ken
4802,Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
4803,As you know Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August th at which point he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA first obtuse marginal and second obtuse marginal.
4804,He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.
4805,His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.
4806,He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed which has stayed in since discharge.
4807,He spent approximately  days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.
4808,Currently he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm however he denies symptoms of active angina congestive failure or sensed arrhythmias.
4809,He is slowly recovering his overall strength.
4810,The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of  creatinine of .

4839,The neck is supple JVP flat carotids are  without significant bruits.
4840,Chest is clear.
4841,Cardiac exam shows normal S physiologically split S with  systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base no significant diastolic murmur or rub.
4842,The abdomen is benign.
4843,Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and  pedal edema.
4844,Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of  PR interval .
4845,QRS .
4846,QT .
4847,axis  degrees.
4848,There is evidence of left bundlebranch block with secondary ST and Twave changes.
4849,An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of  at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.
4850,No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.
4851,Impression and Plan
4852,Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.
4853,I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.
4854,I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately  months and assuming he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period his amiodarone would then be discontinued.
4855,At that time I would also discontinue his Coumadin.
4856,In addition at the time of his diagnostic catheterization he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.
4857,In addition I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.
4858,I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.
4859,He will have routine blood studies obtained today.
4860,I would target his LDL cholesterol to the  range.
4861,Beyond this I have not altered his current regimen.
4862,Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.
4863,Sincerely yours

5004,At  the time he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.
5005,Whether this was a Hodgkins or nonHodgkis lymphoma is unclear to us
5006,but he was treated with bleomycin adriamycin and prednisone for  approximately  weeks.
5007,At that point he was believed to be in  remission and stayed in remission since then.
5008,In  the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he  presented with polyuria polydipsia and blurred vision.

5111,Brookshire MO                                Page      the fact that he is posttransplant has several risk factors for  osteoporosis including prednisone use and a family history of  osteoporosis.
5112,The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it  is about a yearandahalf or so with half a year during his  chemotherapy
5113,years ago and then about a year since his transplant.
5114,The patients history of never having had fractures no bone pain no  height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might  be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant  patients.
5115,However getting a bone density study in the patient like  this makes sense.
5116,We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on  his follow up visit since he cannot have one today for scheduling  reasons.
5117,We will also check vitamin D levels given patients history of  renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to  do for him is to give him vitamin D.
5118,His calcium intake was estimated  to be about
5119,mg.
5120,a day including one cup of milk green leafy  vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.
5121,We would be a little  reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure  without more information about this patient.
5122,The patients diabetes  seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under  fairly good control sounding like they are in the  range although we  dont have access to hemoglobin AC.
5123,Given the fact that it sounds like  he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz we will not pursue this at  the current time unless asked and we will focus primarily on the bone  situation.
5124,Otherwise we will see the patient back or at least talk to

5281,REFair Bill  MR     Dear Dr. Keys     Dr. Oates
5282,and I saw Bill Fair today with regard to his troublesome   right knee.
5283,As you are aware he is a  year old man who is a convenience store manager.
5284,He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years   mainly related to sports injuries.
5285,He has had in particular  years of pain now in his right knee.
5286,It got so   bad
5287,months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that.
5288,It has slowly got better since then.
5289,At present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with   activity but he also has rest and night pain.
5290,He has a restricted walking   distance.
5291,With regard to function he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and   requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.
5292,He has   noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.
5293,With regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of   Tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to   have a colonoscopy in the near future.
5294,He has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.
5295,On examination I note he has bilateral varus knees worse on the right than   the left.
5296,He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.
5297,He has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of   arthritis.
5298,He has a  degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to    degrees.
5299,His varus deformity is not fully correctable.
5300,He has grade    quadriceps power.
5301,Xrays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete   obliteration of joint space on the right side.
5302,I note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment   arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.
5303,We have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial   osteotomy a unicompartmental knee replacement and a total knee replacement.
5304,At present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe   enough to warrant operative intervention.
5305,We would certainly reconsider   should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee   instilling some corticosteroids.
5306,We have advised him that this will only   provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin   some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.
5307,We have organized to see him again in  months time at which stage we will   reassess him.
5308,Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly   ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the   knee and instill some corticosteroid.
5309,With kind regards.

5316,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
5317,Mr. Fair is a yearold patient with a history of diabetes diagnosed
5318,more than  years ago.
5319,He has known complication of retinopathy and is status post bilateral laser surgery about one year ago.
5320,He has no known neuropathy or nephropathy.
5321,He has no known history of CAD CVA or PVD.
5322,He had previously been followed by Dr. Elizabeth Keys at Pioneer Hospital at Findlay until June of this year which time he switched to a new primary care doctor.
5323,At that time he had been on glyburide metformin and Avandia his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia.
5324,He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient.
5325,Over the next weeks to months the patient had progressive peripheral edema fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
5326,He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of
5327,mg orally on this.
5328,He self adjusted his Avandia dose from
5329,mg twice daily to
5330,mg daily.
5331,His prebreakfast blood glucose has been elevated ranging from .
5332,He has had some resolution of his fluid overload with the Lasix and lower dose Avandia.

5406,This is a yearold gentleman with type II diabetes complicated by retinopathy and erectile dysfunction.
5407,He has had inadequate glycemic control on oral agents which are currently at their maximal doses given the intolerable side effects of Avandia.
5408,He has plans for elective knee replacement during the spring and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on Avandia.
5409,.
5410,We will start insulin today initially NPH  units at bedtime to replace his evening dose of glyburide.
5411,We have instructed him on use of the Inolet for insulin administration.

5441,Weymouth Dr Plymouth IN    Dear Dr. Yuan
5442,I saw your patient Bill Fair in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March   and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.
5443,I will be sending a copy of this letter to Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.
5444,Mr. Fair is a yearold male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.
5445,He has had diabetes mellitus for about  years.
5446,About two months ago he started on insulin and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.
5447,His most recent glucose had been in the range of  with his lipids including total cholesterol of  triglycerides  HDL of  and LDL of .
5448,His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH  units in the morning  units in the afternoon glyburide
5449,mg q.d.
5450,and metformin
5451,mg q.d..
5452,He also takes Lasix
5453,mg per day lisinopril
5454,mg per day and Lipitor
5455,mg q.d.
5456,His other risk factors are notable for hypertension which has been labile and borderline high in the past.
5457,He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.
5458,He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.
5459,He does not smoke cigarettes but he is obese.
5460,He has no known history of MI angina or shortness of breath.
5461,His other risk is notable for his family history which includes his father who died at the age of  of an MI as well as leukemia.
5462,His mother died at the age of  of mesothelioma and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.
5463,He had an echo performed on February   in anticipation of his knee surgery in March  and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.
5464,Overall LV function is mildlytomoderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of .
5465,The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.
5466,The apical anterior wall apical lateral wall and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.
5467,The right ventricle was normal in size and function the left atrium was mildly dilated the aortic valve was unremarkable the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mildtomoderate mitral regurgitation and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.
5468,His past medical history is notable for kidney stones which he has had over the past  years or so.
5469,He has had three or four attacks the most recent one was two years ago.
5470,He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.
5471,Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.
5472,He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March  .
5473,Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
5474,He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.
5475,His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
5476,On exam he is obese but comfortable.
5477,Blood pressure is  heart rate of  and regular and weight of  pounds.
5478,Head and neck are unremarkable.
5479,Chest is clear.
5480,Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at  degrees.
5481,PMI is normal.
5482,S and S are normal with a physiologic split.
5483,There is an S and  systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
5484,Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
5485,The abdomen is obese.
5486,Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
5487,Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
5488,Distal pulses are normal.
5489,His resting lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor Rwave progression V through V.
5490,He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.
5491,The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
5492,Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.
5493,This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.
5494,We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.
5495,In addition I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.
5496,He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.
5497,I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.
5498,We will check his Chem today as well as CRP
5499,and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
5500,I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
5501,If any problems develop in the interim please do not hesitate to contact me.
5502,We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.
5503,Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
5504,Kindest personal regards.

5614,This pain lasted  minutes but his shortness of breath persisted.
5615,The shortness of breath was worse with exertion not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths.
5616,He also began to have a nonproductive cough this same day.

5733,In summary Mr. Kaufman is a  year old man with a history of insulinrequiring DM hypertension chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal.
5734,His initial cardiac markers were positive but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure.
5735,He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema.
5736,However his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.
5737,His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with leftsided heart failure possibly caused by an ischemic event.
5738,His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies some of which could occur concurrently including CHF drug toxicity lisinopril and NSAIDs DMassociated nephropathy chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.

6859,M.D.
6860,Patricia is a yearold retired woman righthand dominant who comes with complaints of soreness in her right wrist.
6861,She apparently had a fall which caused substantial pain and some swelling but no bruising.
6862,Brought her in to have an evaluation.
6863,Xrays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary.
6864,Past medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes.
6865,No prior surgeries.
6866,No medications.
6867,No known drug allergies.
6868,Lists no family history of any problems.
6869,Lives alone and used to smoke but quit.
6870,On examination she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side.
6871,No atrophy ecchymosis edema or deformity.
6872,Negative scaphoid shift test.
6873,Slight tenderness over the distal radius.
6874,Normal tendon function.
6875,My impression is that she must have got a mild sprain which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone but whatever this was it has resolved almost entirely she is functioning well and there is no apparent problem
6876,so I will see her back as needed.

7011,Finally could this be a primary pulmonary process If her  sat of  in the ED is true this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative.

7436,Putting together Ms. Falons story from her personal history she has had type  diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease including retinopathy neuropathy and nephropathy.
7437,This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting  months ago using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time.
7438,Also related at least in part to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a nonST elevation MI in December .
7439,Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting going away before she has time to try a SLTNG.
7440,In addition Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal.
7441,She is on a STTh HD schedule but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD.
7442,She did not go to HD today as her SBP was again too low.
7443,Using a home machine Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the s and complains of frequent periods of dizziness especially when getting up from the seated position.
7444,She is unable to lie flat  to orthopnea.
7445,She denies recent fevers chills SOB or chest pain.

7711,She resumed hemodialysis in .
7712,She does have a match with her only daughter but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries which would be required one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant.

7995,Vivian Lea Jorgenson       MR
7996,Dear Dr. Geiger
7997,Thank you for referring your patient Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a  preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September  .
7998,As you know she is a  year old woman with hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease.
7999,She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and  brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has  increased in size it is felt to be a potential malignancy and
8000,she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September  of this year.
8001,In terms of her cardiac history she was well  until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath  and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart  failure.
8002,At that time she had an exercise Thallium scan which  revealed a low work load at only  minutes stopping secondary to  shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a  dilated left ventricle.
8003,In addition she had an echo in June of   which shows an ejection fraction of  with  mitral  regurgitation left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction.
8004,She has never been hospitalized since that time for her  congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good  result.
8005,She currently denies any orthopnea PND angina or  claudication.
8006,She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.
8007,In fact she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her  recollection.
8008,She is able to walk up the  stairs to her house  and can unload groceries from her car up those stairs.
8009,She is  able to shop walk through the grocery store without difficulty  from chest
8010,Jorgenson Vivian Lea  MR                            August       pains or shortness of breath although she occasionally stops  secondary to fatigue.
8011,Her past medical history includes hypertension hyperlipidemia  CHF chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule.
8012,She has never had  surgery.
8013,Her family history is significant for a mother who died  of myocardial infarction at the age of .
8014,Her social history she smoked  packs of cigarettes a day for   years and quit four years ago.
8015,She denies alcohol intravenous  drugs or cocaine use.
8016,She lives with her husband and briefly  worked in Amys Baking Company but for the past  years is an electrical engineer.
8017,She  has no known drug allergies.
8018,Her current medications include Labetalol mg po BID Captopril   po TID Digoxin .mg
8019,po QD
8020,Coumadin  po QD

8022,QD Lasix
8023,po QD Coreg .
8024,po BID Nitroglycerin patch daily  and Gemfibrozil mg
8025,BID.
8026,On physical exam in my office her blood pressure was  in  her left arm and  in her right.
8027,Her heart rate was  when
8028,I saw her although it was  on her EKG today.
8029,Her JVP was   centimeters.
8030,Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid  bruits.
8031,Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles.
8032,Her  heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with  occasional ectopic beats.
8033,She has a normal S and S with a   systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without  radiation.
8034,Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds.
8035,Her  extremities have  distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.
8036,Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of .
8037,She has a  diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin  effects.
8038,She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old  anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.
8039,In summary Ms. Jorgenson is a  year old woman with hypertension  hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease  with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of   likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial  infarction although she has never undergone heart  catheterization.
8040,She is currently undergoing evaluation for a  thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule.
8041,Jorgenson Vivian Lea  MR                            August       Issue number one  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment   given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden  since
8042,I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with  imaging.
8043,If this is similar to her previous study showing only  fixed defects and no reversible ischemia then I feel that she  will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative  myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is  well treated and therefore will not preclude her from having  surgery.
8044,Issue number two is her anticoagulation for low ejection  fraction.
8045,She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection  fraction.
8046,As far as I know she has never had atrial fibrillation
8047,and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or  rhythm.
8048,Therefore I recommend that she stop her Coumadin  days  prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after  surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons  as to how may days she should wait after surgery before  restarting that medication.
8049,She will otherwise remain on her  current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and  primary care physician Dr. Charles Van.
8050,If her stress test  is without reversible defects she need not follow up with me for  further evaluation.
8051,Thank you for referring this interesting patient.
8052,She was seen  and examined with Dr. Voss.

8059,This is the first visit for Ms. Jorgenson who is a  year old woman who presents   for management of papillary thyroid cancer.
8060,Her symptoms began in May    when she felt a prominence in her neck.
8061,She did not experience any dysphagia   or voice changes but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid   examination.
8062,She underwent a thyroid biopsy in June  at a local   hospital.
8063,The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular   cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.
8064,She was   subsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent   thyroidectomy on .
8065,The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there   was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then   reimplanted.
8066,According to the operative report the carcinoma was felt to be   locally extensive though no laryngotracheal nerve invasion was present.
8067,The   pathology revealed a R  cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and   lymphovascular invasion.
8068,There was an additional focus of papillary   carcinoma follicular variant in the L thyroid lobe that was . cm.
8069,Of   note the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative.
8070,The tumor   did stain positively for thyroglobulin.
8071,Since undergoing thyroidectomy Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well.
8072,She has been   maintained on  mcg daily of Levoxyl.
8073,She says that she feels generally
8074,well on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue.
8075,She denies any   changes in her sleep hair skin or bowels.
8076,She does endorse a one pound   weight gain over the last two months.
8077,She denies any paresthesias or other   symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia.
8078,She denies any history of thyroid   disturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer.
8079,She is now referred for   consideration of radioiodine ablation.

8116,Free T at that time was normal at ..
8117,Calcium prior to   surgery was slightly elevated at .
8118,though several calciums drawn after her   surgery were in the mid range.
8119,ImpressionThis is a  year old woman with a history of congestive heart   failure who is now sp total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer.
8120,Ms.   Jorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is   older at the time of diagnosis she had a largesize tumor and she had   multifocal disease.
8121,PlanCheck a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline.
8122,We suspect that   she may be undertreated on her current dose of Levoxyl.
8123,I have recommended   I treatment.
8124,Benefits and risks were discussed.
8125,In addition I think she   would tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal.
8126,TSH and calcium were drawn today.

8138,Dear Dr. Van
8139,I had the pleasure of participating in the care of VivianLee Jorgenson during her recent hospitalization at Goulds Hospital.
8140,This lovely yearold female ended up having no discernable coronary artery disease on catheterization.

8356,INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN
8357,This yearold female presents  with generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent  falls concerning for either an evolving intracranial process  such as a subdural or stroke.
8358,This has been going on for several  weeks however but also presents with melena over the past  several weeks and profound anemia for which she required  transfusion in the Emergency Department.
8359,We did order a CT of  the brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both  given the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls.
8360,This  does not show any large subdural or mass lesion.
8361,She is quite  anemic has melanotic hemepositive stool.
8362,I suspect this is the  etiology
8363,but it seems like it has been a slow progression and  concerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could  represent coronary insufficiency.
8364,She does not have an elevated  troponin at present.
8365,She will need to be further monitored.
8366,She  was transfused here in the Emergency Department given her  profoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained.
8367,Clinically feels better.
8368,I discussed with the patients family  because of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as   further cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as  physical therapy evaluation once the patients acute medical  issues have been addressed.
8369,She will be admitted to the medical  service with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia gastrointestinal  bleeding congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation in  stable condition.

8721,Mr. Jarviss cardiac history began in  when he was shoveling snow.
8722,At that time he developed dizziness diaphoresis and nausea.
8723,He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately  minutes.
8724,His initial EKG showed  mm STE in II III and aVF and  mm STE in V and V.
8725,An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V to V with a max of  mm in V. He never developed chest pain.
8726,An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease.
8727,The LAD had a proximal  stenosis.
8728,The LCx had mid  diffuse disease.

8730,The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated  stenosis with haziness.
8731,Given these findings a .
8732,X mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result.
8733,His peak CK was  during that admission.
8734,An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis.
8735,He was discharged home in  in stable condition and followup with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG.
8736,It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present.
8737,He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on .
8738,The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint.

9542,OK
9543,Dear Dr. Barron
9544,Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.
9545,I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.
9546,Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
9547,Frances is a very pleasant yearold Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension hyperlipidemia and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.
9548,It appears that she had been having a severalmonth history of anginaltype symptoms although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.
9549,On  she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.
9550,She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.
9551,I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a .
9552,x  and .
9553,x
9554,Cypher drugeluting stents to the right coronary artery.
9555,Per her daughters report she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.
9556,Unfortunately we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.
9557,Since her myocardial infarction she actually has felt quite well.
9558,She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.
9559,Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.
9560,She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.
9561,Her past medical history is notable for hypertension hyperlipidemia and glucose intolerance.
9562,Her present medications include aspirin
9563,mg a day Plavix
9564,mg a day metformin
9565,mg a day simvastatin
9566,mg a day nitroglycerin p.r.n.
9567,amlodipine
9568,mg a day hydrochlorothiazide
9569,mg a day and lisinopril
9570,mg a day.
9571,She has no known drug allergies.
9572,Social History
9573,She is married and has three children.
9574,She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.
9575,Landis can be reached on a cell phone at .
9576,She has never used tobacco.
9577,Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.
9578,There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.
9579,Review of Systems
9580,Cardiac
9581,No chest pain PND orthopnea dyspnea or lower extremity edema.
9582,Musculoskeletal
9583,No myalgias or arthralgias on lipidlowering therapy.
9584,All others are negative.
9585,On physical examination she is an overweight yet wellappearing female in no apparent distress.
9586,Her blood pressure is  and her heart rate is  beats per minute.
9587,Her weight is  pounds.
9588,Her neck shows  carotid upstrokes.
9589,There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.
9590,The carotid upstrokes are full.
9591,Her lungs are clear to auscultation.
9592,The heart is normal to palpation no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.
9593,The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a  systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.
9594,The abdomen is obese soft nontender with normal bowel sounds.
9595,Her extremities show no edema.
9596,Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of  with a normal axis and intervals.
9597,She has Q waves and Twave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.
9598,I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.
9599,On  she underwent an echocardiogram.
9600,She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of  mmHg.
9601,She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of . msec.
9602,There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.
9603,She has only mild mitral regurgitation.
9604,In summary well we do not have records it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.
9605,She did receive drugeluting stents.
9606,The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.
9607,What is less clear however is the status of her other coronaries there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.
9608,From a clinical standpoint I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.
9609,She is fairly asymptomatic and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.
9610,I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.
9611,To this end I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.
9612,We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.
9613,In terms of her lipids it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.
9614,The goal for her LDL should be in the s and her HDLs ideally be in the s.
9615,In terms of antithrombotic therapy she did receive drugeluting stents.
9616,Therefore she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.
9617,After a year it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.
9618,However up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.
9619,She is on a very good medical regimen although I think she would benefit from a betablocker.
9620,The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extendedrelease metoprolol at
9621,mg a day.
9622,This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.
9623,I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.
9624,Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.
9625,If you have any further questions regarding her management do not hesitate to contact me.

9631,OK
9632,Dear Dr. Barron   I would like to give you followup on our mutual patient Frances Preston.
9633,As you know I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia.
9634,We performed a catheterization on .
9635,We utilized the right radial artery for access.
9636,We found that she developed a significant instent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drugeluting stent.
9637,This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms.
9638,We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a .
9639,x
9640,Taxus drugeluting stent.
9641,The stent was postdilated with a  mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure.
9642,The final angiographic result was excellent.
9643,The following morning she was doing quite well
9644,and we discharged her later in the day.
9645,She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure though I will likely favor indefinite therapy.
9646,I plan on seeing her again on  in followup.
9647,If you have any further questions regarding her care please do not hesitate to contact me.

10048,He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and I believe Dr. Inglis.
10049,He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning.
10050,His episodes of chest pain are interesting.
10051,He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching.
10052,The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset.
10053,They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge.

10089,Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se.
10090,It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past.
10091,We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed.
10092,I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress.

10151,We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation.
10152,We have discussed treatment options including rate control rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation.
10153,We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to RO ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to RO structural heart disease.
10154,We have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment.
10155,We have started him on Toprol XL
10156,mg daily.
10157,If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation.
10158,We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management.
10159,He has a CHAD Score of .
10160,We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin
10161,mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time.
10162,We will complete diagnostic testing follow up with the results and then proceed.
10163,We have encouraged him to call with any questions concerns or changes in health status.

10532,Abdomen is soft and  nontender.
10533,Skin is intact warm and dry.
10534,Extremities
10535,He has  got  edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is  symmetric.
10536,Neuropsych
10537,He is oriented x moves all extremities  equally.
10538,LABORATORY DATA
10539,ECG shows a sinus rhythm at  with poor Rwave  progression but no acute ST segment abnormalities.
10540,Chest xray  shows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural  effusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild  pulmonary edema.
10541,Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of . with  creatinine of .
10542,CKMB of .
10543,with normal index and CK of .
10544,BNP is still pending.
10545,INR is .
10546,which is therapeutic on  Coumadin.
10547,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE
10548,At the outside Emergency
10549,Department he did receive Lasix
10550,and he put off approximately   liters of urine since then with significant symptomatic  improvement in his dyspnea.
10551,He has no further episodes of chest  pain or pressure.
10552,I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison  the SAH cardiologist oncall.
10553,I believe this patient has CHF  exacerbation.
10554,He also was recently cardioverted which   explain his troponin elevation.
10555,Additionally his CHF  exacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation and I  doubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.
10556,At this point  the patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on  Coumadin.
10557,We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at  this time.
10558,However he will have serial cardiac biomarkers will  be admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for  further evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart  failure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.
10559,DIAGNOSIS
10560,Congestive heart failure exacerbation troponin  elevation and diabetes.
10561,DISPOSITION

11483,CT of chest with a PE      protocol did not reveal any thrombus.
11484,HOSPITAL COURSE
11485,The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth      of general surgery.
11486,The patient had expressed an interest in considering      colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January .
11487,Initially this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during      surgery.
11488,After extensive      conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family and with the patient      I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and      perioperative healing far outweigh any potential benefits that she may      have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not      to pursue this.

11490,The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
11491,Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.
11492,She will      continue to be treated with antihypertensives.
11493,Her chest wall pain is      likely due to esophageal spasm.
11494,Gastrointestinal Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.
11495,Chronic pain syndrome She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and      fibromyalgia.
11496,This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower      extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications.
11497,At the time we      will continue pain medications for her comfort.
11498,Continue aggressive bowel      regimen.
11499,Feeding The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to      eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.

11547,His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm grading it as  out of  vs.  out of  to which his wife agrees.
11548,They both attribute it to the Prilosec.
11549,He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.
11550,He has no snoring daytime hypersomnolence or morning headaches  no longer falls asleep at work.
11551,Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.
11552,No lower extremity edema swollen glands or fevers.

11573,My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.
11574,Impression    .
11575,Interstitial lung disease
11576,Mild objective impairment by functional status.
11577,Pulmonary function tests
11578,Overall these were stable and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.
11579,However as I reviewed with the patient and his wife it is well established that  of the time another disorder such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.
11580,There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration other than that associated with GE reflux to explain his lung disease.
11581,He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon although this likely would necessitate lowdose steroids  the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.
11582,.
11583,GE reflux
11584,This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
11585,If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle he can have very good control of this.
11586,.
11587,Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.
11588,.
11589,Possible sleep disorder
11590,Currently is entirely without symptoms now that his reflux is well controlled.

11594,Diabetes
11595,Better controlled.
11596,.
11597,Obesity
11598,He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.
11599,As I mentioned to him he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight but he is starting to make some progress.
11600,Recommendations    .
11601,Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d.
11602,dosing as well as lifestyle modifications including marked decrease in caffeine intake.
11603,.
11604,Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.
11605,.
11606,Cardiovascular evaluation by you prior to his surgery would be appreciated.

11613,Dear Dr. Givens    I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Horn today in followup.
11614,VATS biopsy on  showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia  a rather unusual reading.
11615,Since the biopsy he has recovered well but is mildly more short of breath than previous.
11616,For example he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.
11617,The cough is slightly increased to  but is markedly better than on presentation.
11618,He has no leg edema chest pain skin rash joint problems or fevers.
11619,He has managed to lose  lbs. by giving up sweets and his sugars are slightly better.

11644,Impression    .
11645,Biopsyproven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
11646,The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia.
11647,I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the lowbenefit regiment of prednisone with an immunosuppressant agent.
11648,I think he may be a very good candidate for gammainterferon but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.
11649,I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux.
11650,If the disease was indeed progressing we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.
11651,The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.

11749,Having reviewed his recent data would suggest that we change his current insulin to NPH
11750,Regular  scale qAM before  breakfast Regular  scale qPM before  supper NPH  at bedtime QID Regular sliding scale These initial doses will need to be adjusted based on experience and on any changes in the steroid doses.
11751,I have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration.
11752,I would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis.
11753,Would change the steroid dosing to AM  PM hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses PM first if possible.
11754,He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency.
11755,If you agree would start iron repletion.
11756,Note that in addition to the iron studies his MCV though still normal has come down over time.
11757,Thanks.

12460,Pt has been undergoing treament for persistent UTI.
12461,While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology.
12462,CHF is argued against by normal BNP especially in comparison to elevated BNP in s on prior admission for CHF clear CXR clear lung exam and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission.
12463,If one believes her EKGs demonstrated ischemic changes this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent.

12844,On her last visit her blood pressure was   and on check today it was .
12845,We discussed the possibility that she  continue her saltrestricted diet.
12846,We also discussed that she continue  her own exercise both of which she does faithfully and we also discussed  the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.
12847,She currently  weighs  lbs. and stands approximately  tall.
12848,As far as longterm prognosis my current plan is to evaluate her blood  pressure on another subsequent visit in the next  weeks and at that  time if it is elevated we will consider either going up on her nifedipine  XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine seeing if we can possibly  gain some better control or possibly adding another agent.
12849,However at  this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure  and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood  pressure on her first admission which was systolic blood pressures in the  ss.
12850,Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation  now appears to be much more stable.

12864,Patient appears to be doing fine.
12865,She has been compliant with her  antihypertensive regimen which consists of nifedipine and also  hydrochlorothiazide.
12866,Since our last meeting the patient has lost  approximately  to  pounds.
12867,She has been exercising on a daily basis  and eating very well both of which have had very very significant and  beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination  was  in both arms.
12868,The patient was complaining of some ankle  swelling and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been  on furosemide which was a holdover from the time of her most recent  admission.
12869,I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide which
12870,I feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her  symptoms over the next few days.
12871,The final issue with the patient today is low back pain which she has had  chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in .
12872,We  have tried a whole host of conservative measures which have included bed  rest nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and back exercises.
12873,The  patient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for  services to obtain further help and hopefully treatment of her pain.
12874,Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming.
12875,Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months.
12876,ADDENDUM
12877,The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient  agreed to have her cholesterol checked today but does not want to have  either a mammogram or a Pap smear.
12878,She complains that she does not have  faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used  to and does not want to have done.
12879,I attempted to discuss the need and why  it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do  this with the patient in the future but for now the patient adamantly  refuses either of the two examinations.

12948,yo M who comes to the office in search of a second opinion about his care at the Boaz Nursing Home in Lynden.
12949,He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in  at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH.
12950,Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT.
12951,Apparently he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was ..
12952,He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments.
12953,The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan all of which were negative.
12954,He has the reports here with him.
12955,The bone scan does show an abnormality at L but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion.
12956,He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis.
12957,This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him.
12958,He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week however is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.
12959,Impression In reviewing the patients limited records that he brings and his history it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH.
12960,I have reassured him of this and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future.
12961,I also informed him that he will likely need antiandrogen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA.
12962,He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.

13587,Agree with reducing plavix to  QD for now in combination with low dose ASA.
13588,Despite low level cardiac marker elevation there is little suggest an intercurrent coronary syndrome currently complicating the UGIB.
13589,Would try to continue antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of  days and preferably for  days in the setting of recently placed bare metal stents if tolerable from a hemodynamic and hemostatic perspective.
13590,Agree with switching to short term beta blocker and holding lasix for now given apparent volume depletion.
13591,Continue high dose statin ARB and low dose CCB for BP control.
13592,If UGIB continues to stabilize would prefer to maintain on H blocker rather than PPI to limit interference with antiplatelet therapy with plavix.

14159,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
14160,This is a  year old woman with diabetes and  obesity.
14161,Her problems are as follows   .
14162,Diabetes.
14163,She was sent to me from OBGYN because of her high glucose       and she was put on insulin by me.
14164,Xitlali Xia followed her in       order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as       she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.
14165,She finally comes back and I am relieved but she has not brought any       list of her blood sugars.
14166,She says she does take them about twice a       day
14167,and she did write them down
14168,but her daughter ripped them up and       threw them away.
14169,She says that they never go higher than  that       they usually are about .
14170,It was  this morning before       breakfast she says.
14171,She says it does get as low as  and five or       six times it has been below .
14172,She does say she eats three regular       meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten       breakfast she said no.
14173,She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
14174,I will check a hemoglobin AC today.
14175,I expressed to her again how       important it is that she eat three regular meals but not sweets.
14176,She had been eating a lot of chocolate.
14177,She says she has gotten off       of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it       then.
14178,She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will       help her with her diet.
14179,If her diet does get better maybe we can       wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.
14180,I explained to her too       that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might       be able to get her off the insulin.
14181,This seemed to be something that       she would like to do.
14182,Hopefully the nutritionist can help.
14183,I also       told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her       to take her blood sugar before breakfast lunch dinner and sleep       and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was       really going on and whether they are getting too low.
14184,She denies any       kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as .
14185,I am       wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.
14186,She had no shakiness no loss of consciousness no dizziness no       nothing.
14187,She felt totally normal.
14188,So hopefully she will really       record these and we will get a better idea.
14189,She said this always       happens in the morning.
14190,She kept contradicting herself and had no       documentation.
14191,I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
14192,Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.
14193,She does drink juice
14194,but I went over the symptoms again with her.
14195,She will call me if she       does have any.
14196,.
14197,Left ankle pain.
14198,I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.
14199,She said that she may do some surgery on her.
14200,.
14201,Dysuria.
14202,She says this is totally resolved after giving her the       Bactrim.
14203,.
14204,Yeast infection.
14205,She said this has also resolved.
14206,.
14207,She complains of headache.
14208,She says these have been going on for two       or three months that light and noise bother her when she has some.
14209,She has had nausea and vomited once.
14210,This happened pretty much every       day and it can be at any time of the day.
14211,Tylenol and Advil did not       help.
14212,She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in       the back of her left ear very faintly
14213,and then it spreads from there.
14214,But she has no further prodrome.
14215,She says it is a banging kind of       pain that is rhythmic.
14216,She also says she does see stars in front of       her eyes when it happens.
14217,I asked her if she had any hearing loss       and she said that she hears voices but people are not there       sometimes.
14218,It has been happening for a couple of weeks.
14219,I discussed       this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like       migraines.
14220,I will not image her head now as there is no evidence       that this would be something to do with brain tumor.
14221,Her neuro exam       was totally normal.
14222,Cranial nerves IIXII were checked and intact.
14223,Her gait was normal.
14224,Light touch was touched.
14225,Her toes were       downgoing.
14226,Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.
14227,Her disks were       sharp.
14228,EOMI PERRL.
14229,I gave her a prescription for Motrin
14230,mg PO       t.i.d.
14231,and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind       her left ear.
14232,I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
14233,.
14234,Health maintenance.
14235,I thought that since she is diabetic and obese       that she might benefit from a flu shot.
14236,She has no interest in this       at all.
14237,Her blood pressure was  in the left arm with a thigh       cuff.
14238,Her pulse was .
14239,Her blood sugar was  and her weight was       .

14515,Type  diabetes.
14516,Her hemoglobin Ac has continued to run in   the ..
14517,She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to   try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.
14518,At this point it   is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin   regimen starting with b.i.d.
14519,NPH and we will refer her to the   diabetic teaching nurse and see her back in about a month   with a plan to transition her at that time.
14520,Her urine   microalbumin was negative a few months ago.
14521,We will recheck   her hemoglobin Ac today.
14522,She has been to the ophthalmologist   recently and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.
14523,.
14524,Regarding her chest pain her persistent intermittent chest   pain is somewhat concerning.
14525,She does have coronary disease   as per her MIBI just over a year ago.
14526,She is taking an   aspirin and a betablocker.
14527,Her EKG today is normal and she   has been symptom free for at least the past  days even with   exertion.
14528,Given this I advised her should she have recurrent   pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to   the emergency room otherwise to continue taking her aspirin   and betablocker.
14529,I will repeat her stress test to see if her   ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider   referring her to Cardiology.
14530,Youngman Codi          Page         .
14531,Regarding her hypertension given her diabetes we would   prefer better blood pressure control.
14532,She agreed to try the   lisinopril again at a small dose and will let me know if she   thinks it disagrees with her.
14533,I told her I felt the headache   was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.
14534,.
14535,Regarding health maintenance when I see her back in a month
14536,I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot as she left   today without receiving one.

14827,Vernon ME       RE    Jaquante Xuereb
14828,SRI       Dear Dr.
14829,You
14830,I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient Mr. Jaquante Xuereb in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here at the Santa Rosa Infirmary today.
14831,As you remember he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fempop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the belowknee popliteal artery.
14832,He returns today for follow up evaluation.
14833,He has a warm wellperfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.
14834,Unfortunately over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis.
14835,He had been on a course of p.o.
14836,antibiotics over a week ago for treatment of strep throat as well.
14837,The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema tenderness or drainage from his leg.
14838,My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics bedrest and elevate.
14839,We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q. hour basis.
14840,In addition he has intact femoral pulses on the left side.
14841,He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region.
14842,Most recent vascular lab studies dated November   reveal an ABI of . on the right .
14843,on the left.
14844,I will keep you informed as to the status of Mr. Xuereb.
14845,My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high chance of losing his limb at the knee level.
14846,If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure please feel free to contact me directly.

16094,DIAGNOSIS
16095,Bilateral hand numbness and pain recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome.
16096,SUBJECTIVE
16097,The patient is a yearold righthand dominant male with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus and renal failure requiring hemodialysis who was has had bilateral hand numbness for several years but getting worse within the last year or so.
16098,The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar  years ago appearance of symptoms.
16099,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
16100,Hypertension diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.
16101,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
16102,Bilateral eye surgeries right shoulder surgeries and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.
16103,CURRENT MEDICATIONS
16104,Multiple antibiotics including isoniazid doxycycline insulin Cardura Glucophage Elavil and Biaxin.
16105,Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.
16106,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
16107,On today s examination the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.
16108,Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted the fourth trigger release which was performed in  as well.
16109,The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.
16110,There is no locking or triggering but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.
16111,Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.
16112,However abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.
16113,Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand but otherwise normal examination.
16114,IMPRESSION
16115,As above.
16116,PLAN
16117,My recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.
16118,In addition to this I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.
16119,It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.

16852,Patient wife reliable past medical records from Pennsylvania Hospital  CC  chest pain
16853,HPI Mr. Eubanks is a  yearold man with hypertension mild diabetes mellitus type II and gout who presents with  hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.
16854,In addition to HTN and DM Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD brother sister and prior history of mild spontaneously resolving chest pain in early .
16855,He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG exercise tolerance test and Myoview study.
16856,Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads and PVC   s in recovery.
16857,The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT which was terminated after  minutes because of leg fatigue.
16858,On the Myoview study a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.
16859,Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was .
16860,A subsequent exercise echo was normal.
16861,Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured  with systolic pressures noted as high as .
16862,His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around  at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.
16863,Hemoglobin AC in  was . and diabetes has been managed with only diet.
16864,He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October  for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.
16865,Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until  days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain once in the morning and once in the evening.
16866,These episodes lasted only  minutes and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.
16867,The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.
16868,His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.
16869,He was awakened near  am by  burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.
16870,Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath sweating nausea or vomiting headache lightheadedness fever or vision changes.
16871,The pain persisted for  hours without improvement or alleviating factors prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.
16872,Review of systems was positive for polyuria increased thirst mild nonproductive cough postnasal drip and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.
16873,The patient denies recent or past history of edema GERD claudication clots hemoptysis hematemesis dyspnea on exertion orthopnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea wheezing fatigue appetite or weight changes or night sweats.
16874,In the emergency department the patient was given aspirin lopressor sublingual nitroglycerin and L O by nasal cannula and chest pain subsequently resolved.
16875,EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.
16876,Subsequent EKG

16972,Assessment
16973,Mr. Eubanks is a  yearold man with HTN DM II and gout who presents with  hours of severe chest pain.
16974,The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia myocardial infarction aortic dissection pneumothorax pulmonary embolus bronchitis pleurisy GERDesophageal spasm musculoskeletalchest wall pain and anxiety.
16975,The sudden onset of severe chest pain awaking him from sleep raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI aortic dissection or PE.
16976,The patient has elevated DDimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings dyspnea pleuritic chest pain cough hemoptysis tachypnea signs of DVT or CTCTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.
16977,The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans which have       sensitivity.
16978,In addition he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection including syncope pulse deficits and new murmur.
16979,The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin  aspirin.
16980,Moreover the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago and has multiple cardiac risk factors.
16981,This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.
16982,EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation although Twave inversions were present in some leads.
16983,The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x  sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.
16984,The patient may have either a nonST elevation MI or unstable angina.
16985,The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.
16986,Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.

17011,Pager    Intern Addendum I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student.
17012,In brief the pt is a M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms.
17013,He did feel slightly SOB
17014,but there was no N V diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time.
17015,The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin.
17016,Upon further questioning he thinks he had two similar episodes last week.
17017,He has not had any DOE PND or LE edema.
17018,He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb  when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital.
17019,He does not know the details of the workup.
17020,Of note the pt does not smoke is not on ASA and has several family members with CAD but no men  or women.
17021,He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose.
17022,In the ED he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after  nitro.
17023,HR was  and BP .
17024,He was given ASA and a BB.
17025,Initially his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V. Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free showed flipped Ts in V. There were no old EKGs available for comparison.
17026,He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac
17027,Hct .
17028,A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE.
17029,the ddimer was elevated.
17030,His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation.
17031,On exam he was in NAD and was CP free.
17032,Heart was RRR lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema.
17033,ASA and BB were cont.
17034,The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test.
17035,However the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead.
17036,This is planned for this morning.
17037,Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.

17335,Dear Dr. Ito  Ida was seen back today for evaluation of Sjogrens as well as left wrist
17336,pain.
17337,Her Sjogrens has been reasonably stable.
17338,She still remains with  difficulty in controlling her blood sugar.
17339,She has continued difficulty with  her oral cavity.
17340,She has had no extraglandular symptoms  specifically  polyneuropathy myopathy or purpura.
17341,She uses artificial tears and saliva.
17342,She remains on insulin and estrogens.
17343,She has a oneweek history of pain and swelling of her left wrist.
17344,She was  seen at the Graduate Hospital Emergency Room several days ago.
17345,Radiographs of the  wrist show chondrocalcinosis.
17346,She was started on Motrin with some response
17347,but still has active symptoms.
17348,She is wearing a splint.
17349,Today on exam she is afebrile.
17350,There was OA involving the DIP joints.
17351,PIPs  and MCPs were nontender.
17352,The left wrist showed swelling and heat with  diminished motion.
17353,Right wrist showed full range of motion.
17354,Elbows  shoulders hips knees ankles and feet did not show active synovitis.
17355,There was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.
17356,I aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique.
17357,No fluid was obtained.
17358,I injected it with  mg of DepoMedrol.
17359,Clinically I think she has had pseudogout.
17360,She has chondrocalcinosis on  radiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease.
17361,In  addition she has primary Sjogrens.
17362,The two diseases are unrelated.
17363,In addition to injection of her wrist I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex
17364,mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues.
17365,She should probably  take that for about five to seven days.
17366,Side effects were reviewed.
17367,I would like to see her back in four months.
17368,She will be returning to you  for further care in the interim.

17893,MR     Dear Xzavior
17894,I had the pleasure of seeing Lloyd Gregg for follow  up of his emphysema.
17895,The patient reports that he continues to lead a very  active lifestyle working as a sales representative roughly  hours  a day frequently lifting  pound boxes.
17896,When he  returns home from work he cooks dinner and this  combined with his work schedule and picking up his  daughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited  him from a regular exercise program.
17897,Needless to say  he has remained active.
17898,He is not limited in these  activities by his respiratory function with the  exception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with  heavy lifting.
17899,He uses albuterol during these  instances anywhere between  and  to  times per day.
17900,His usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly   liters per minute.
17901,He knows that when his PEFR falls  to below  for  days in a row to contact you for  advice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had   burst of prednisone since our last visit in April.
17902,His medical regimen is notable for Flovent   micrograms per puffs  puffs twice a day Serevent MDI   puffs twice a day Allopurinol colchicine Vasotec  and the albuterol as mentioned above.
17903,RE Lloyd Gregg              November        MR
17904,The patients review of systems is notable for the absence of  fevers chills sweats chest discomfort symptoms of GERD  change in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.

17922,My impression is that the patients severe airflow obstruction  secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen.
17923,I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active  life.
17924,We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of  prednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact  information in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of  a flare.
17925,I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.
17926,To  try and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of  prednisone through the winter months we have also begun
17927,Combivent  puffs
17928,times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to  be used  puffs in each nostril once a day.
17929,We talked about  vaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the  influenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia  vaccine.
17930,Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Greggs care.

18195,CARDIOLOGY
18196,PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC    Reason for visit     Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
18197,She was instructed to come to the office
18198,and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases    Interval History
18199,Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
18200,She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
18201,She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to .
18202,Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured .
18203,She had global hypokinesis.
18204,She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
18205,She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation  at rest  with exertion.
18206,Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
18207,d dimer  rnage.
18208,BNP elevated at .
18209,VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
18210,Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
18211,Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
18212,A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
18213,Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately  at the time of PA gram.
18214,The patient was commenced on Lasix mg.
18215,Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
18216,Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking

18224,She relates that her dyspnea is better
18225,She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
18226,She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement continued medical therapy.

18260,Impression
18261,Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
18262,Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
18263,She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at  with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
18264,Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
18265,At this point repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.
18266,Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditisundetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
18267,In addition the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.
18268,She relates that she will call our office.

19884,Dear Dr. Ventura
19885,Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.
19886,This patient with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated on hemodialysis  weeks ago in MH.
19887,She has been doing well except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for the past week.

19899,Head and neck examination was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.
19900,On cardiovascular examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no peripheral edema.
19901,Heart sounds were normal.
19902,Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained  protein and  glucose.
19903,Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center.
19904,There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection.
19905,She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary tract infection.
19906,Because of her early satiety she has been eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride

19963,Peggy Tinsley                                              FPM       Dear Dr. Stafford
19964,I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs. Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.
19965,In summary she is a  year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic since the age of  and has been on hemodialysis since .
19966,By report her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease.
19967,In viewing her present history she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.
19968,Her three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.
19969,She does however  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.
19970,These episodes are relieved by nitroglycerin.
19971,Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved by slowing down.
19972,In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present only predialysis she has been and continues to be a smoker.
19973,Her cholesterol by one report was  mgdl.
19974,I dont have fractionations and her family history is unknown.
19975,A report of an echocardiogram from April of  shows mild ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency preserved LV size and function.
19976,She had an exercise tolerance test in February of .
19977,On a modified protocol she went for less than   minutes.
19978,This is equivalent to not even completing stage  of the standard Bruce.
19979,With that she did develop chest pain and had
19980,mm of ST depression.
19981,That study was accompanied by both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum consistent with prior nontransmural infarct with exercise induced ischemia.
19982,As was apparent to those involved even the nonisotope portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.
19983,That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time I only have the report.
19984,However from this report there was preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies.
19985,Coronary angiography showed by report diffuse involvement of proximal midLAD without specific focal stenosis until an  mid LAD.
19986,The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.
19987,The right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete stenosis.
19988,At that time the recommendation was to continue medical therapy.
19989,Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with prempro .
19990,mg once a day tenormin
19991,mg qd aspirin one every other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins iron and twice daily insulin therapy.
19992,In rounding out her medical history her surgical procedures have involved the hemodialysis access.
19993,She has had one pregnancy  years ago without complications.
19994,I also elicited a history of some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.
19995,This was difficult to pin down but is of some concern.
19996,On exam her blood pressure was   mm
19997,Hg pulse  regular her weight  lbs.
19998,Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left arm.
19999,There was a right carotid bruit neck veins were not distended.
20000,Lungs were clear PMI was displaced and sustained.
20001,There was an S no S and there was a holo systolic murmur at the apex.
20002,Abdomen was benign femoral pulses were intact extremities were without edema.
20003,The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm diffuse STT changes.
20004,There were no pathologic Q waves.
20005,Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for transplant candidacy I am concerned about her current cardiac status.
20006,She is a young diabetic woman symptomatic of both shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test has limited functional capacity.
20007,The coronary angiography reveals a presence of multivessel disease.
20008,Even without seeing the primary data which I hope to do in the next week it would be unlikely that she would be an angioplasty candidate given the poor results in diabetics.
20009,Therefore coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery  bypass surgery.
20010,Obviously I would like to review the films first and speak with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her antianginals.
20011,I would also like to add pravastatin at this time starting with only
20012,mg and obtain noninvasive studies of the carotids.
20013,As indicated although the focus of this evaluation was her suitability for transplantation the issue of controlling symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more pressing.
20014,I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in her care.
20015,Sincerely                                          Quentin U. Johnson M.D. Ph.D.

20222,Roberta Vincent      MR    Dear Dr. Long
20223,Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.
20224,I had the pleasure of seeing her on November  .
20225,Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
20226,Ms. Vincent is a yearold mother of eight with chronic renal failure of unknown etiology.
20227,She is six years status post hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult leiomyosarcoma was discovered.
20228,She has an extensive history of hidradenitis obesity and hypertension.
20229,She had one stillborn infant one premature infant and three spontaneous abortions.

20242,On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a yearold woman in no distress.
20243,Her weight is . kilograms or  lbs.
20244,Temperature is normal.
20245,Pulse is  beats per minute.
20246,Blood pressure is .
20247,There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.
20248,There is a buffalo hump.
20249,The lungs show scattered wheezing.
20250,Cardiovascular exam is normal.
20251,There are discolorations of the skin across the neck upper extremities and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not raised.
20252,The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.
20253,There is a ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.
20254,The extremities show trace edema.
20255,There are several areas of superficial petechiae.
20256,In summary this yearold woman has chronic renal failure of unclear etiology.
20257,She does report an episode of lower extremity swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.
20258,ThisRoberta Vincent MR                            November       raises the possibility of a postinfectious glomerulonephritis now in a chronic phase.
20259,Other diagnostic possibilities include other forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions.
20260,Nevertheless I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased risk due to her body habitus.
20261,I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms. Vincent.
20262,Although she has no medical conditions which would preclude livingrelated or cadaveric kidney transplantation her obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.
20263,I have encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or transplantation.
20264,Nevertheless her appearance is quite reminiscent of Cushings disease and this should be worked up if it has not been performed previously.
20265,I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her kidney function and a followup appointment in two months time to meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV fistula or placement of a graft.
20266,Thank you once again for your kind referral.

20276,We had the privilege of seeing your patient Mrs. Roberta Vincent in the Renal Services Clinic on January  .
20277,We will not repeat her history as you know it well.
20278,Over the past three months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue occasionally sleeping more than  hours per night forgetfulness and tingling of the fingers and toes.
20279,She has maintained a relatively good appetite and denies nausea vomiting or shortness of breath.
20280,An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December   revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately  ml per minute suggesting profound loss of renal function.
20281,On physical examination today her weight is . kilograms or  pounds.
20282,Blood pressure is  pulse is  and regular.
20283,The lungs are clear.
20284,There is no peripheral edema.
20285,Again there marked cushingoid features.
20286,Despite overall weight loss Mrs. Vincent comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as facial hair over the past several months.
20287,In summary Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of uremia.
20288,Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start dialysis within the next several months.
20289,We have arranged to recheck her chemistries today.
20290,We would also recommend that she undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.
20291,Although renal failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional androgenic features in woman this is beyond ordinary.
20292,Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

20549,He was       admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.
20550,The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the       time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability workup was       sent off which was negative.

20552,He states that       he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not       occur during his hospital course.

20582,Given his current physical examination and lack of recent PT       check since time of discharge on the th I am sending a stat PT.
20583,I       encouraged the patient to elevate the leg.
20584,My feeling is that the DVT       has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not       therapeutic at the present time.
20585,I have arranged for the patient to       follow up with Aguilar the Internal Medicine nurse on Wednesday for a repeat       check of his PT.
20586,I left instructions that I should be called       immediately upon receiving the PT value I also arranged for the       patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a       cane to help with ambulation.
20587,Adult onset diabetes.
20588,I will recheck a hemoglobin AC value at his       next office visit.
20589,A finger stick in the office approximately three       hours after eating is .

20774,The patient received an EKG which  showed normal sinus rhythm.
20775,No significant ST or T  abnormalities no significant peaked T waves are consistent with  his previous EKG.
20776,PA lateral chest xray showed no evidence of  acute cardiopulmonary infiltrates.
20777,Only labs which resulted  initially were CBC which showed a hematocrit of .
20778,platelets   and white count of ..
20779,We made contact with the renal  fellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the  dialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this  patient.
20780,His potassium was not back at the time that he left the  department however he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias  on the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is  very atypical for cardiac symptom not being so we will reassess  when he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure  that this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome.
20781,After he  left the department additional labs came back include INR of .
20782,and a Chem showing a sodium of  a potassium of .
20783,a  chloride of  bicarbonate of  BUN of  creatinine .
20784,glucose of  CK of  troponin of less than .
20785,calcium  . phosphorus of . and magnesium of . and promptly called  the renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have  the patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to  treat him there acutely.
20786,Again after the dialysis the patient  will return to the Emergency Department.
20787,We will reassess if  symptoms and see how he feels check a second cardiac enzymes.
20788,If he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no  chest pain we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for  acute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not  acute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he  will be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis  schedule.

20873,M wacute on chronic low back and left buttock pain now improved after pain medication in the ED.
20874,The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance.
20875,Given the patients history of prostate CA he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well.
20876,Pt was offered MRI today however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI he has tried before with medications.
20877,Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and fu with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week.
20878,Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

20893,NP     Record date    January   initial office note Frank Caldwell
20894,He is a  year old man who is referred by Dr. Freda Erickson of Mauston for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas.
20895,He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as    zingers     or  weeks ago.
20896,Workup then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on.
20897,This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein.
20898,He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions.
20899,A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion.
20900,Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma.
20901,The mass itself is about    cm in diameter.
20902,His family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer.
20903,He denies smoking drinking but exercises by walking about  days a week.
20904,His past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in  cholecystectomy in  prostatectomy for cancer in  and resection of a lung cancer in .
20905,His current medications include Lipitor mg a day Glyburide mg three times a day he has been taking it for       years Lisinopril mg a day and a baby aspirin.
20906,He is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan
20907,it is unclear whether the two are related.
20908,His review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis.
20909,He has had some mild recent weight loss.
20910,He denies symptoms of heart disease neurologic disease or respiratory disease.
20911,His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
20912,I think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time.
20913,With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion he should first be treated with chemoradiation.
20914,He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery probably not resection but perhaps intraoperative radiation therapy.
20915,I   ve explained this to him his wife and daughter.
20916,After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation with consideration of subsequent IORT.
20917,He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us.
20918,This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up.
20919,I will also get a CA today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation.
20920,I spent  minutes in consultation and coordination of care.

21467,Basically I told him to take Flonase  twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip  cleared up.

21492,Dear Dr. Short
21493,Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr. Craft for the  possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.
21494,As you know he  is a  year old righthanded man with an extensive past medical  history for a rheumatological disease.
21495,His past medical history  briefly is that he was diagnosed with lupus in  and at that  time he had a butterfly rash he complained of chronic fatigue and
21496,he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were  characterized as complex partial type events and elevated double stranded DNA of  and ANA of  with a homogenous pattern.
21497,All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.
21498,He was  treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes  that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman his  symptoms and seizures went away.
21499,Since that time he has had a  recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and  neck pressure within his head.
21500,He considers himself to have  vascular headaches with facial weakness ringing in his ears  numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm excessive  salivation and increased appetite.
21501,In describing his headache he  noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and  has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing  quality.
21502,It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not  associated with nausea vomiting or paraesthesias.
21503,There is no  family history of migraines as well.
21504,Also during his headache
21505,events he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any  nausea or vomiting.
21506,Past medical history
21507,As per above.
21508,Medicval issues include  bipolar II with  diagnosed in  hypothalamic  gonadism hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of  migraine headaches.
21509,His current medications include Lamictal Risperdal testolactone  chromisene Levoxyl Altace for hypertension ibuprofen p.r.n.
21510,and  prednisone p.r.n.
21511,He is allergic to penicillin Lozol bee stings and allopurinol.
21512,There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the  use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of  remission.

21536,Overall impression   year old righthanded male with a history  of lupus in the past.
21537,His recent blood work shows that his  doublestranded DNA was negative.
21538,Taking into consideration his  current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I  evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular  disease at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of  central nervous system vasculitis.
21539,He was told that he is at a  high risk for having a stroke secondary to  having high blood  pressure and  having an elevated cholesterol.
21540,If it is  possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start  a cholesterollowering agent he is to discuss this with you and  also consider starting aspirin mg PO q.d. for primary prevention  of heart disease.
21541,He was informed that it is possible that there  is some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his  hormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his  symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is  not clear.
21542,Thank you for letting me take part in your patients healthcare.

23606,Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to  me.
23607,I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery  disease hypertension and diabetes.
23608,The patient has had a positive  exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt  that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.
23609,However patient was  overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by  approximately  lb.
23610,at which time he would be suitable for cardiac  catheterization on the Pontiac equipment.
23611,Patient was seen last night  in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain  which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right  flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.
23612,On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.
23613,His exam was  notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.
23614,His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as  well.
23615,His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells however  did have  uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.
23616,An  abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the  presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.
23617,IVP  was recommended by the radiologist for followup.
23618,He was given Toradol  in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some  Motrin with the followup to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.
23619,I was called by
23620,the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right  flank.
23621,On it patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was  brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.
23622,On exam  he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with  pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his  abdomen.
23623,Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no  peritoneal signs.
23624,Assessment and Plan
23625,While I am concerned about his possible renal  pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be  musculoskeletal in nature however due to his other medical problems I  feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will  undergo this study this afternoon.
23626,I have also sent off a repeat CBC  with differential a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to  rule out pancreatitis.
23627,Of note patient does have a history of peptic  ulcer disease however he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and  reports no episodes of hematemesis hematochezia or melena.
23628,He is also  status post cholecystectomy.
23629,I will review his IVP later today and make  further therapeutic interventions at that time.

24028,Dear Dr. Calhoun
24029,We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism.
24030,As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant yearold man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in  chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus .
24031,in the lumbar spine and minus .
24032,in the femoral neck.
24033,We. started zoledronic acid IV in  that he tolerated fine.
24034,In addition we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around
24035,mgdL and elevated FSH and LH levels.
24036,We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.
24037,He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication.

24079,The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy.
24080,I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism.
24081,He will continue the current treatment with calcium vitamin D testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid.

24352,His mother died of a stroke at the age of .
24353,He has a single sister who is  years of age and has no history of heart troubles.
24354,Physical Examination
24355,His blood pressure is  BLANK of  beats per minute.
24356,In general he is overweight elderly man in no distress.
24357,Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.
24358,Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.
24359,Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases but otherwise clear.
24360,There is no wheezing.
24361,Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S and S.
24362,There is no audible murmur rub or gallop.
24363,Abdomen is obese soft and nontender.
24364,Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.
24365,There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.
24366,Recent blood work reveals an INR of . on .
24367,EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately  beats per minute.
24368,There are some nonspecific Twave abnormalities but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.
24369,There is some low voltage in the limb leads though I suspect this is related to his habitus.
24370,Overall Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant yearold man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.
24371,He appears to be functional class III.
24372,He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.
24373,Moreover he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.
24374,We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.
24375,We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.
24376,However given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately  month postablation may be required to adjudicate success.
24377,Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.
24378,We will leave this decision to them.
24379,Moreover prior to the ablation we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.
24380,Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.
24381,We will be in touch following the procedure.
24382,As always feel free to call with any questions.

24392,Problems
24393,Congestive heart failure
24394,He had admission to MCH  with CHF.
24395,He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit.
24396,He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms.
24397,Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well.
24398,Most recent echo from  showed severely depressed LV systolic function EF  global hypokinesis with anteroapical akinesis.
24399,Moderate LV margin.

24402,Dilated aortic loop.
24403,Normal RV size and function.
24404,Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR.
24405,He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB orthopnea or pedal edema.
24406,He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathyCHF.
24407,coronary artery disease
24408,After his admission for CHF he underwent dolbutamine stress test on  which revealed a small area of ischemia in midanterior and a moderate to largesized area of ischemia inferiorly
24409,and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress.
24410,Based on this he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization.
24411,he underwent stenting X of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch.
24412,Notably his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery.
24413,The L main had no significant lesions.
24414,The LAD had a  lesion just before the first diagonal and the midLAD was occluded.
24415,He had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous          therapy.
24416,He was discharged the following day without complications.
24417,Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD see below he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina.
24418,pacemaker         SP DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome  and doing well.

24431,He continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently they are typically in the s and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
24432,He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process.
24433,Will check FBS HBAC and urine for microalbumin today.
24434,hypercholesterolemia
24435,He has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor.
24436,We will check fasting lipids and LFTs today.

24458,It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk so that he can only limp less than a block and has difficulty with stairs.
24459,Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible.
24460,Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.

24752,He had one episode of CHF which was managed as an outpatient and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously.
24753,At the present time he has no active symptoms of CHF he continues to sleep on two large pillows at night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema.
24754,He does continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix.
24755,.
24756,Coronary artery disease.
24757,Despite all of his active issues he has no current symptoms of angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.
24758,.
24759,Status post infected staph left knee arthroplasty.
24760,His left TKR also required removal due to infection
24761,and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd .
24762,He has had no recurrent infection but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical issues.
24763,He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while down in West Virginia but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area.
24764,.
24765,Diabetes mellitus.
24766,Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to twelve months he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly his diabetes regimen has been gradually decreased.
24767,He is now on Glyburide
24768,mg b.i.d.
24769,and he reports that his fasting sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the  to  range.
24770,He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than .
24771,We will check his HbAc today and continue his current regimen.

24796,DISPOSITION
24797,Close ongoing follow up.
24798,ADDENDUM
24799,In reviewing patients medical records after he left today I found mention of both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations.
24800,At this time he was quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy.
24801,He did deny abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.
24802,At this point my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and send in to me by mail.
24803,I have also sent off a CBC today.
24804,I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his next visit.
24805,If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool then we will need to discuss more aggressive workup but given his overall health condition I do not feel the need to be aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.

24812,With this surgery only his left second toe remained   gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.
24813,He will likely either autoamputate or will require amputation of his left second toe   which remains gangrenous
24814,but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left   foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.

25014,Known risk factors at that time in addition to his age and gender were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.
25015,Details of that presentation as per my  office note.
25016,Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV.
25017,The PLV lesions each received .
25018,xmm Minivision bare metal stents and the distal RCA lesion received a . xmm Vision bare metal stent.
25019,A nondominant Left Circumflex had a  stenosis that was not intervened upon.
25020,There was nonobstructive disease in the LAD.
25021,A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of  and no wall motion abnormalities.
25022,Left atrium was slightly dilated to mm.
25023,RV function was normal.
25024,He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program see below.
25025,He had an outpatient ETTMIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.
25026,He had this on  and he exercised for  minutes  METS and achieved a heart rate  of predicted.
25027,He did not experience chest pain had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue.
25028,The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.
25029,LV EF .
25030,He had a recurrent episode of chest pain somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like and presented to the ED in March.
25031,His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETTMIBI in which he exercised for  mins
25032,sec achieving
25033,METS  MPHR peak double product K.
25034,A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not studylimiting.
25035,The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal without evidence of ischemia or infarction.
25036,LV EF .
25037,He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.
25038,He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.
25039,He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI and has remained abstinent since then.
25040,He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
25041,His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.
25042,Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.
25043,This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.
25044,Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.
25045,He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities i.e. muscolskeletal in nature.
25046,He has  flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath which has not changed since the onset of the CP.
25047,He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test.
25048,He denies lightheadedness or syncope.
25049,No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.
25050,He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.
25051,He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.
25052,He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.

25075,Assessment and plan     year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI  treated with  bare metal stents to the RCA territory Hypertension Hyperlipidemia and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.
25076,Coronary artery disease Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory and he has now completed over a  month course of Plavix therapy.
25077,Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs i.e. Motrin he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point.
25078,He will continue the medical regimen of ASA mg daily Lipitor mg daily Toprol XL
25079,mg daily and Lisinopril mg daily.
25080,His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.
25081,The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETTMIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.
25082,He does have a known  stenosis in a nondominant LCx but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory.
25083,His ECG today is unchanged from priors.
25084,However given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms.
25085,I will call the patient in several days time and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.
25086,Secondary prevention Most recent Lipid panel in  on Lipitor mg daily shows TC
25087,LDL  HDL  and TGs .
25088,His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.
25089,Given this along with an elevated TG value we will start Niaspan.
25090,He can start with
25091,mg qhs for the first  weeks to help get through the common adverse effects i.e. flushing.
25092,He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin  minutes before to help minimize side effects.
25093,After a few weeks he can increase to the maintenance dose of
25094,mg qhs.
25095,He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward.
25096,He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.
25097,Hypertension Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL
25098,mg daily and Lisinopril mg daily.
25099,He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.

25468,Review of systems
25469,Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of  chest pains over the last  years.
25470,However he does say that his last  chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.
25471,When asked where the  pain was he put his hand over this midepigastrium and stated that the  pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his  angioplasty.
25472,He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was  relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.
25473,At the  time he was just sitting on his couch watching television.
25474,He has no  history of exertional angina over the last several years.
25475,However this  complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.

25488,Cardiovascular.
25489,Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given       his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest       pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.
25490,Given that he is on       no current cardiac medication except for aspirin I will decide to       initiate therapy with diltiazem CD mg PO q.d. in an attempt to       control his blood pressure and heart rate.
25491,I also encouraged him to       continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of       nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.
25492,The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and       maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.
25493,After he       has been on a stable dose for several days we will perform an       outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any       evidence of ischemia at this time.
25494,If he does we will recommend a       cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be       causing syms of rest angina.
25495,The case was discussed with any       cardiacs that are on call.
25496,.
25497,Given the patients history of coronary artery disease I sent an       SMA level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does       have with a cholesterol of  and hypertriglyceridemia which he also       has at a level of .
25498,He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in       the past however he has not been taking it for the last year.
25499,I       instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his       diet and explained which food contain those products.
25500,I will also       initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease       both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.
25501,We will start him       off on simvastatin mg PO q.d.
25502,later this week.

25815,Parrish Christopher
25816,SFC      Dear Dr. Kirk
25817,I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Christopher Parrish in follow up today.
25818,He is a yearold righthanded man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December   with left arm weakness ataxia and dysarthria.
25819,The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.
25820,An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.
25821,The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission despite being heparinized.
25822,The following day he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.
25823,Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.
25824,There was no critical carotid stenosis.
25825,He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction dilated left atrium very mild inferior hypokinesis and no patent foramen ovale.
25826,He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.
25827,His cholesterol level was  with an HDL of .
25828,It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.
25829,He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.
25830,He had been on aspirin prior Plavix was added to his regimen.
25831,Since his discharge from the hospital he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.
25832,He has had no further episodes of weakness numbness tingling ataxia dysarthria or dysphagia.
25833,He has no symptoms of aphasia.
25834,He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event which he feels has improved.
25835,I would agree with him.
25836,He also has regained some strength in the left leg and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.
25837,Unfortunately he has not regained any use of the left arm.
25838,He has not had any problems with spasms.
25839,His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.
25840,He had an inferior myocardial infarction in .
25841,He had a quadruple bypass in .
25842,His last stress test in  showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.
25843,He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.
25844,He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.
25845,He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.
25846,His medications currently include clonidine .

25867,He had been on Captopril earlier
25868,but he has since been taken off that medicine.
25869,He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.
25870,I assume he is still on this medicine although he did not specifically state so.
25871,He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.
25872,The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.
25873,The patient quit smoking  years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.
25874,There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers but no family history of stroke.
25875,On examination he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.
25876,His blood pressure was .
25877,His language was intact.
25878,His speech was somewhat dysarthric although this was improved from his admission.
25879,He was alert and oriented.
25880,His conversation was appropriate.
25881,The visual fields were full.
25882,The pupils were equal and reactive at  mm.
25883,Facial sensation was normal.
25884,There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.
25885,The tongue and palate were midline.
25886,The patient had  flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.
25887,There was atrophy of the left biceps.
25888,There was full range of motion of the joints.
25889,The patient had  left
25890,iliopsoas  hip extensors  left quadriceps  left ankle dorsiflexors and  ankle plantar flexors.
25891,The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.
25892,His right side was .
25893,He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.
25894,His right toe was downgoing.
25895,Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.
25896,I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.
25897,Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.
25898,He was in a wheelchair and his gait was not assessed.
25899,Mr. Parrishs recovery is progressing.
25900,He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.
25901,I hope that this will be the case.
25902,Unfortunately his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.
25903,I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.
25904,His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.
25905,I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled as has been done and to continue an anticholesterol agent.
25906,I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.
25907,The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.
25908,I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.
25909,However since he has been on this medicine so long it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.
25910,He should continue on an aspirin a day.
25911,He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.
25912,I recommended to him that in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.
25913,We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.
25914,This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.
25915,After six months if he has had no further clinical events it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.
25916,I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.
25917,I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one years time.
25918,The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.

26836,Internal Medicine   Shattuck Street IM   Citrus Ridge MT        Re Russell Urban
26837,WRH
26838,Dear Dr. Ussery
26839,I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.
26840,As you know Mr. Urban is a very pleasant yearold gentleman who on July   while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell    epigastric discomfort and profound diaphoresis.
26841,He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.
26842,By the time he arrived his symptoms had abated.
26843,He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers and was admitted to the medicine service to ruleout a myocardial infarction.
26844,That evening he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.
26845,He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.
26846,The next morning he underwent cardiac ultrasound which revealed an ejection fraction of  and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.
26847,Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.
26848,He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal nonobstructive disease of the left system.
26849,This artery was stented with total of three stents two Express stents .
26850,x  mm and one Pixel stent .
26851,x  mm encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.
26852,A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of  with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.
26853,He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of  and a peak troponin of ..
26854,A followup echocardiogram was performed on July  .
26855,This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to  the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.
26856,His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.
26857,Because of this a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies normal thyroid function and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern.
26858,He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.
26859,Since his myocardial infarction Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.
26860,He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.
26861,He has had no symptoms of angina dyspnea nausea or diaphoresis.
26862,He has felt very well.
26863,He continues to take his medications without difficulty and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.
26864,His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.
26865,Of note he reports to me that about  or  years ago while living in Georgia he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.
26866,He was evaluated and released.
26867,He never had any further testing.
26868,He did not have a stress test cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.
26869,Prior to his admission he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.
26870,His medications include aspirin
26871,mg daily Plavix
26872,mg daily
26873,Lipitor
26874,mg daily lisinopril
26875,mg daily and carvedilol .
26876,mg twice each day.
26877,He has no known drug allergies.
26878,Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports Inc he moved to Georgia where he lived for  years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.
26879,He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.
26880,He has been working in Borders.
26881,He currently lives in Toledo Montana with his wife.
26882,He has no children.
26883,He smoked  to  packs per day for about  years but has not smoked since his hospitalization.
26884,He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.
26885,He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had  myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.
26886,On physical exam his blood pressure was  mmHg in his right arm and  mmHg in his left arm.
26887,His heart rate is  and regular.
26888,In general he is in no apparent distress.
26889,His jugular venous pressure is  cm of water.
26890,His chest is clear to auscultation without rales wheezes or rhonchi.
26891,His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S and S.
26892,He has no murmurs rubs or gallops.
26893,His abdomen is benign.
26894,His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing cyanosis or edema.
26895,On vascular exam his carotid pulses are  brisk and without bruits.
26896,His femoral pulses are  brisk and without bruits.
26897,His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.
26898,The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.
26899,His distal pulses are  and symmetric throughout.
26900,His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of  mgdl LDL of  mgdl and HDL of mgdl.
26901,His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.
26902,He has T wave inversions in III and aVF and he has a greater than  degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.
26903,Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.
26904,He exercised for  minutes  seconds achieving a maximum workload of  METS and a peak double product of .
26905,His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.
26906,His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction.
26907,There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.
26908,His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at .
26909,In short Mr. Urban is a yearold who had an inferior myocardial infarction but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.
26910,Also his systolic function has improved over time.
26911,I think there are two processes going on.
26912,One is coronary artery disease.
26913,Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.
26914,The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.
26915,Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.
26916,He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy but a transient one.
26917,I suspect that this is myocarditis.
26918,Unfortunatley I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.
26919,It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.
26920,From the aspect of his coronary artery disease he will continue on aspirin for life.
26921,He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least  months.
26922,For his hyperlipidemia I agree with Lipitor and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.
26923,His LDL goal will be less than .
26924,He is well betablocked on his carvedilol and we will continue with the current dose of .
26925,mg twice daily.
26926,His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from  to
26927,mg daily.
26928,I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.
26929,I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.
26930,Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.
26931,The patient was seen and examined and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.

26942,Citrus Ridge MT     Dear Dr. Ussery    I saw Mr. Urban in followup in the office today.
26943,Since his last visit in November he has been feeling well.
26944,He has had no angina no exertional dyspnea no shortness of breath no orthopnea
26945,no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea no palpitations and no other symptoms of note.
26946,Since his last visit with me he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.
26947,He found this program to be very helpful he sis very well with the program.
26948,He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise.
26949,He has stopped smoking.
26950,There have been no difficulties with his medications.
26951,On  he had a followup echocardiogram done this study shows an LV ejection fraction of  with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis there is trace mitral regurgitation and aortic sclerosis but no stenosis.
26952,Notably he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be  mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildlytomoderately hypokinetic.
26953,He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms.
26954,His review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail.

26965,Physical examination
26966,He appears quite well and is in no apparent distress.
26967,His blood pressure is  mmHg and his pulse rate is  beats per minutes and regular.
26968,His JVP is  cm of water with no Kussmauls sign.
26969,His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
26970,His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S and S.
26971,He has no S or S gallop and no audible murmurs.
26972,His abdomen is soft.
26973,It is neither tender nor distended.
26974,He has normal bowel sounds.
26975,His extremities are warm and well perfused.
26976,He has no edema.
26977,Impression
26978,This is a  yearold man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July .
26979,Additionally he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of  percent.
26980,He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction.
26981,Notably his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction.
26982,The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear.
26983,There is likely a component of left heart failure.
26984,In addition he may have right heart failure outofproportion to left heart failure he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and lastly he may have obstructive sleep apnea.
26985,He reports to me that he does snore at night and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing.
26986,This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration.
26987,Recommendations Initially I am going to start him on Lasix
26988,mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this.
26989,The rest of his regimen is quite good and I intend to continue them.
26990,To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this I am going to obtain first a chest xray secondly a pulmonary function testing and lastly a sleep study.
26991,If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly.
26992,I will see him again in six months time.
26993,Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman.

27352,Mr. Austin is a  year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador  days ago.
27353,He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.
27354,While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe midsternal pain without diaphoresis pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as sharp burning pressure.
27355,He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within  minutes.
27356,There days later pain reccurred again it lasted about  minutes but this time he went to ED.
27357,An EKG was normal and he was discharged on NG.
27358,Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized.
27359,On July st he was catheterized and found to have diffuse CAD involving several vessels.
27360,Stent placement was not attempted.
27361,His LV EF was
27362,and he was transferred to a medical ward.
27363,A day later on July rd he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July  on the following medication    ASA

27466,Dear Gray        I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today.
27467,As you know he is a yearold gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at  in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.
27468,I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.
27469,I have reviewed his records
27470,and I have summarized the findings.
27471,The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.
27472,At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.
27473,He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto.
27474,He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD  sequential lesions  and  first OM and his right  dominant vessel with an  proximal and then   distal.
27475,An LV gram showed an EF of  with just mild mitral regurgitation.
27476,An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent.
27477,Since he has returned to America several weeks ago he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic.
27478,Since then he has had no further episodes.
27479,ROS Denies PND orthopnea symptoms of TIA stroke lightheaded or syncope.
27480,He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.
27481,PMH Diabetes hypertension hypercholesterolemia  stroke numbness in his right hand and leg but that had predominantly resolved.
27482,Meds aspirin

27494,Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.
27495,On exam he looks well.
27496,His heart rate is in the .
27497,His blood pressure was .
27498,His carotids were  with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
27499,His jugular venous pressures were not elevated.
27500,His chest was clear to auscultation.
27501,His cardiac exam revealed a   holosystolic murmur at the apex.
27502,His abdomen was soft.
27503,Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses.
27504,Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.
27505,In summary Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking yearold gentleman with diabetes and a significant vessel disease.
27506,He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.
27507,I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.

27524,Patient education was completed with respect to  medication review weight restrictionliftingactivities cardiac rehabilitation.
27525,Overall I am quite pleased with progress.
27526,He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks.
27527,He  seems to be making an excellent recovery from surgery.
27528,Thank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman.
27529,I am confident the surgery will afford  significant and lasting benefit and relief from symptoms of angina .
27530,I would consider increasing his Toprol dose but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in followup.
27531,I am releasing  him to your care.
27532,We would be happy to see him at any time in the future if you should so desire.

27801,Booked for CPE but current symptoms took precedence.
27802,Pt presents very discouraged over escalating Lasix doses and persistant problems with reccurent edema and cough each time relieved by increasing diuretics so ACEI cough seems unlikely.
27803,Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance.
27804,Did see sleep lab tech tried new settings and mask on new machine but still tolerates poorly.
27805,When discussed in some detail notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time.
27806,Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate.
27807,Without exploring details greatly we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid.
27808,Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.
27809,Pt has started atkins dt with good success  in first week and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin which is great.
27810,so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.
27811,We discussed some options...
27812,Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction.
27813,He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter exploring the PTSD history and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this.
27814,OSA
27815,Likely has near optimal mask set up now...

27996,Re
27997,William Potts      MR     Dear Matt
27998,I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Potts in follow up today.
27999,As you know he recently had a complicated hospital course.
28000,He underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD including  and  stenoses.
28001,The first marginal branch had a  ostial stenosis.
28002,The right coronary artery had  and  stenoses respectively.
28003,The PDA had a  narrowing.
28004,Given his very significant wish not to have bypass surgery it was decided to proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as the obtuse marginal.
28005,It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel and not worth going after at this time.
28006,The RCA was successfully stented but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left ventricular branch.
28007,By the end of the procedure flow had been restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch but Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial infarction.
28008,Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular branch the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated.
28009,Mr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure.
28010,The second exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging.
28011,He exercised for nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol and experienced chest pain.
28012,He had a maximal blood pressure of  and a heart rate of .
28013,MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial infarction of the basal  of the inferior wall.
28014,There was moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the territory of the RCA.
28015,Given these findings it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts undergo bypass surgery.
28016,Mr. Potts was discharged on aspirin Ticlid
28017,mg b.i.d.
28018,Atorvastatin
28019,mg q.h.s.
28020,Atenolol
28021,mg b.i.d.
28022,Imdur
28023,mg q.d.
28024,He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin.
28025,Of note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress recently.
28026,His yearold mother has been at Whitehead recovering William Potts MR                       January     from a hip fracture.
28027,He is having difficulty arranging the appropriate insurance to cover her medications.
28028,Mr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.
28029,This occurs with increased activity and is relief with either rest andor  nitroglycerin.
28030,He has decreased his work level considerably and is relatively sedentary.
28031,On physical exam he was well appearing and in no distress.
28032,He had a blood pressure of  with a heart rate of .
28033,His weight was  pounds.
28034,Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion.
28035,Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of  degrees a nondisplaced PMI with a normal S and S without murmurs rubs or gallops.
28036,Carotids are  bilaterally without bruits.
28037,His abdomen is soft nontender.
28038,There is no organomegaly and no hepatojugular reflux.
28039,Extremities are without edema.
28040,Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of .
28041,Intervals are ... with an axis of  degrees.
28042,There are flipped Twaves in III and AVF.
28043,I did not have an old electrocardiogram here for comparison.
28044,Therefore Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with mild exertion.
28045,He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery.
28046,He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work by his physicians that the Screen Actors Guild will make a good case for this.
28047,There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to return to work as an actor.
28048,Given Mr. Pottss current feeling I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery.
28049,It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his  yearold mother at home along with his wife.
28050,His mother currently uses a walker and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in the house.
28051,He understands this and if his chest pain should become more frequent intense or prolonged he will immediately call me.
28052,If Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery I will see him in two weeks at NDNH.
28053,With best regards.

29341,Brady Duvall       MR      Dear Patricia     I saw Brady Duvall again today.
29342,He has been very stable  clinically over these past six months.
29343,I believe this represents  a composite of the following three major changes in his medical  regimen.
29344,As you know we have discontinued all beta blockers
29345,and this has been associated with a symptomatic stability.
29346,He  had biventricular pacing box placed certainly contributing to  his overall improved status and he is now taking a regular dose  of Lasix.
29347,He is on
29348,mg alternating with
29349,mg per day.
29350,He  does have symptoms of fatigue but his overall volume status is  quite reasonable.
29351,He is currently on Aldactone
29352,mg daily and
29353,Lasix
29354,mg per day alternating with
29355,mg per day Captopril  .
29356,mg p.o.
29357,t.i.d.
29358,Zocor insulin Glucophage aspirin and  mexiletine.
29359,His amiodarone has been discontinued.
29360,He does have  asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia often paced out of this
29361,but I am reluctant to recommend ablation therapy for him at the  present time.
29362,He has not been shocked by his ICD.
29363,Functionally he seems quite stable.
29364,He does have mild fatigue
29365,but is otherwise reasonably active.
29366,He will hopefully be  traveling to Miami this spring.
29367,Physical examination today is of note for a weight of  lbs.
29368,His blood pressure is  his resting pulse .
29369,His neck  veins are in fact quite unimpressive.
29370,There is minimal jugular  distention perhaps  cm.
29371,There is no hepatojugular reflux.

29375,S and S seem normal.
29376,No S no gallop and no  murmur or mitral regurgitation.
29377,Abdomen is benign without  palpable liver or spleen and there was no peripheral edema.
29378,There are bilateral varicosities.

29395,The test was stopped due    to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.

29409,Peripheral examination demonstrated no    peripheral examination and  bilateral peripheral pulses.
29410,EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal    EKG.
29411,I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive    coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the    probability of her having single vessel coronary artery    disease as the culprit for her chest pain.
29412,We reviewed the    options which include medical therapy andor coronary    angiography and possible angioplasty.
29413,I made no solid    recommendations for her but suggested that the angioplasty    approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead    to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical    therapy which would also be a well supported decision and    I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of    single vessel disease does not shorten ones life span and    only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom    tolerance.
29414,She and her husband are going to reflect on    these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the    week.
29415,If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography    and possible angioplasty we will schedule her immediately    in Cardiology.
29416,I have scheduled followup in one month regardless to see    her in the office.
29417,Please do not hesitate to contact me if    I can be of any further assistance.

29741,This  yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years.
29742,He underwent CABG x  in  at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB.
29743,Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts.
29744,He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within  weeks of CABG at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed.
29745,Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD
29746,but it was PTCAd with no real relief of his symptoms.
29747,Last year he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD.
29748,There was no PCI option available.
29749,He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved but the dyspnea has persisted.
29750,Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic.
29751,He now presented for cath.
29752,Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a  stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch.
29753,The middistal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to .
29754,The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis.
29755,LCX has  stenosis proximal to the first OM.
29756,RCA has  stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG.
29757,The LIMAgt D is patent and the SVGgt RCA is patent.
29758,The SVGgt LAD is not visualized.

30560,I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients Ms. Benitez in my cardiovascular clinic for followup for palpitations hypertension and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.
30561,As you know she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night.
30562,She has been taking quinine for this however develops palpitations whenever she takes the quinine.
30563,She has not been taking this since the initial two doses.
30564,I suspect that her leg cramps are probably secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.
30565,I have told her to eat a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg cramps in the evening.
30566,In the meantime her EKG showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of  per minute.
30567,There is borderline first degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged from previous tracing.
30568,We will continue her on Vasotec
30569,mg bid as well as Lopressor .
30570,mg bid.
30571,She will see me in followup in three months time.

30578,I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients Ms. Wonda Benitez in my cardiovascular clinic for followup status post coronary artery bypass surgery and pounding headaches.
30579,As you know we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior wall ischemia.
30580,I wasnt sure whether or not this ischemia was new.
30581,On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes she did not have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.
30582,Therefore I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not bypass this area.
30583,She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous venous grafts to the circumflex territory the OM and the diagonal.
30584,She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I recommended we continue her current cardiac medications.
30585,However she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a history of otitis media in her right ear.
30586,Therefore I think it wouldnt be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.
30587,In the meantime I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during these episodes.
30588,I suspect that her blood pressure rise during these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem with her cardiovascular system.
30589,She will return to see me in followup in three months time at which time I will check her cholesterol level.
30590,Again thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient.
30591,Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions.

30624,MRN      Dear Usha
30625,I had the pleasure of seeing one of your patients Ms. Benitez in  my Cardiovascular Clinic today for followup status post coronary  artery bypass surgery.
30626,As you know Ms. Benitez has been having a  terrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest  discomfort.
30627,One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was  fasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.
30628,Both of  these episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.
30629,I  am concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier  Persantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her  test and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine.
30630,Currently she denies any PND orthopnea or chest discomfort.
30631,She  continues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking  corticosteroid shots for that.
30632,On physical examination she is an anxious concerned elderly  woman.
30633,Blood pressure is  in the left arm.
30634,Jugular venous  pulse is not observed.
30635,She has bilateral carotid bruits.
30636,Chest  exam is clear.
30637,Cardiac exam shows an S gallop a normal S a  physiologically split S and a  systolic murmur at the left  sternal border.
30638,Abdominal exam is benign.
30639,Peripheral exam shows  trace pedal edema.
30640,EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of  beats per minute.
30641,There are Q waves in V through V consistent with an old  anterolateral MI.
30642,The tracing was otherwise unchanged compared  with previous tracings.

30645,MRN                           November
30646,IMPRESSION
30647,I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for a  Persantine thallium test as soon as possible.
30648,If she can  exercise on this test that would be even better.
30649,When the  results are back I will get back you regarding further  recommendations.
30650,My hope is that we will not have to
30651,revascularize her again.

30667,She has been reasonably stable since
30668,I saw her last in July.
30669,She has had several episodes of chest  discomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite  transient.
30670,The frequency has been less than one time per month.
30671,The last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping  mall.
30672,She continued to walk and her symptom resolved.
30673,She has  not had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
30674,She has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia denying  transient hemiparesis hemiparesthesia or amaurosis fugax.
30675,She  denies claudication but does admit to back pain bilateral hip  pain with walking.
30676,She still notes paresthesias of both feet.
30677,She continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.

30717,Neck veins  are  cm above the mid right atrium.
30718,There are bilateral carotid  bruits.
30719,Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to  auscultation.
30720,On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth  intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
30721,There is a  left  ventricular lift.
30722,The first heart sound is normal.
30723,The second      Benitez Wonda                                    MRN   November                        is split physiologically.
30724,There is a grade  mid systolic  murmur at the apex and a grade  systolic ejection murmur along
30725,the left sternal border.
30726,There is a fourth heart sound at the  apex.
30727,Abdominal examination reveals no masses no  hepatosplenomegaly.
30728,Extremities are notable for  bilateral  femoral pulses palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft  pulses absent bilateral popliteal pulses  right dorsalis  pedis absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal  pulses.
30729,Her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree
30730,AV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral  myocardial infarction.
30731,There has been no diagnostic change since  July  .
30732,Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October    showed a  stenosis of the right internal carotid artery  and a  stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
30733,The  velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent  calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February  .
30734,Graft scans obtained on October   demonstrated patent left
30735,femoralanterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased  velocities consistent with a greater than  stenosis at the mid  thigh level and this was increased from a study of August  .
30736,The right femoraldorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent  with no evidence of significant stenoses.
30737,In summary her problems relevant to this visit include     .
30738,Coronary artery disease.
30739,Status post coronary artery bypass  surgery.
30740,LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and  posterolateral left ventricular branch.
30741,She has occasional and  very transient episodes of angina.
30742,I have suggested continuing
30743,her current medical regimen.
30744,As noted previously I prefer to  manage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.
30745,.
30746,Carotid artery disease.
30747,She is asymptomatic.
30748,I recommend  periodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound.
30749,.
30750,Peripheral arterial disease.
30751,Both grafts are patent but the  left femoralanterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have  a significant stenosis.
30752,I have asked her to discuss this finding  with you further.

30915,Mr Ulysses is an  yom with hp PVD sp multiple bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and a nonhealing wound on the RLE.
30916,Most recently he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on .
30917,The wound was overlying the BPG.
30918,He was made NWB on R with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly.
30919,He has been followed in clinic.
30920,Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago recently his wound has been concerning for nonhealing.
30921,In clinic his RLE is ischemic and there is a concern for wound infection.
30922,The patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past  weeks with associated increase in pain especially with VAC changes.
30923,He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery.
30924,His foot became increasingly discolored and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene.

31452,Armando Newton M.D.
31453,Mrs. Francesca SergioSteven is a yearold Hispanic female who presents with a newonset acute MI.
31454,She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease but has a long history of insulindependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
31455,She had been in her usual state of health until about  weeks ago when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.
31456,She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.
31457,She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have newonset STsegment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.
31458,There was also poor Rwave progression V through V.
31459,She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at  mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.
31460,She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with  mitral regurgitation.
31461,There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.
31462,The right coronary artery was small with a  proximal stenosis.
31463,The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drugeluting stent.
31464,She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to  mmHg.
31465,She had an estimated  ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.
31466,Cardiac index was . with SVR of .
31467,She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.
31468,Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril
31469,mg q.d. and atenolol
31470,mg q.d.
31471,She also has insulindependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.
31472,Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.
31473,Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
31474,She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.
31475,Review of systems show no fever chills nausea or vomiting.
31476,On exam she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially  with a heart rate of  and regular.
31477,Followup pressure  with a heart rate of  beats per minute.
31478,Head and neck were unremarkable.
31479,Chest is clear.
31480,Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at  degrees.
31481,PMI is normal.
31482,S and S were normal with a physiological split.
31483,There is an S and a  systolic ejection murmur as well as a  to
31484,holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.
31485,There is no
31486,S.
31487,Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.
31488,Bowel sounds are normal.
31489,Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.
31490,Calf site is clean without bruits.
31491,Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.
31492,Her resting lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.
31493,Other lab values included creatinine .
31494,with normal electrolytes hematocrit is .
31495,white blood cell count .
31496,with platelets .
31497,Liver function tests are normal.
31498,A portable chest xray shows pulmonary edema.
31499,Mrs. SergioSteven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.
31500,She has had her circumflex which is a very large vessel well treated now with a drugeluting stent and her wedge has come down and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.
31501,At this point we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin Plavix heparin continue the Integrilin as well as Lasix and nitrates.
31502,We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated and also plan betablockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.
31503,She certainly has coexistent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.
31504,At this point if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.

32106,Dear Dr. Fernandes      Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient Mr. Christian Mullen this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.
32107,It has been nearly  months since his last visit here and in the interim time has been having discomfort involving both of his hips thighs and calves.
32108,As you well know Mr. Mullen is a delightful yearold gentleman with history of hypertension hyperlipidemia coronary artery disease type  diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November  followed by right external right internal and right common femoral artery revascularization in February .
32109,Despite the technical success of both procedures he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.
32110,When we had last evaluated him in November  we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aortoiliac anatomy.
32111,At the time he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.
32112,Unfortunately despite these measures he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.
32113,Symptoms are noticeable between  and  yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.
32114,Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately .
32115,minutes.
32116,He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.
32117,He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs in fact he is actually able to climb  stairs to his office without limitation.
32118,From the cardiac perspective Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness pressure or shortness of breath.
32119,We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly  years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.

32166,Assessment and plan
32167,Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful yearold gentleman with history of coronary artery disease hypertension hyperlipidemia type  diabetes mellitus peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip buttock thigh and claudication.
32168,Mr. Mullens symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.
32169,Interestingly he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in  and .
32170,On examination today his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.
32171,We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies however these revealed supranormal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.
32172,Likewise we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a noninvasive imaging study i.e. CT angiogram however this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.
32173,Accordingly Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plusminus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.
32174,It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullens symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.
32175,Likewise he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.
32176,We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.
32177,He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.
32178,He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.
32179,With your permission we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plusminus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.
32180,Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness we certainly recommend blood pressure of  or below and LDL cholesterol  or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.
32181,We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

32202,Dear Dr. Cooper    I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Christian Mullen today in the office in followup for his peripheral artery disease as well as his coronary disease.
32203,I permanently follow him for PAD as I know he follows with Dr. Fernandes for his coronary disease.
32204,Regarding his peripheral disease he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy performed at my request by Dr. Fredrick Xa couple of years ago.
32205,This alleviated some of his left leg claudication though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf.
32206,The right calf is what bothers him more with symptoms that are earlier in onset.
32207,They occurred about  yards of walking on the flat.
32208,While Chris is affected by this it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living.
32209,He also continues to travel on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair his partner next week and also continues to work actively.
32210,The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight.
32211,As he says he put on about  pounds after his coronary bypass graft in  and he has had trouble losing the weight.
32212,He is considering weight reduction surgery but has not made a decision about this yet.
32213,He is struggling with the decision.
32214,I would support him either way in this regard encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so.
32215,In terms of his lower extremities his exam demonstrates diminished pulses absent to palpation in both ankles but they are audible by Doppler.
32216,Both feet are well perfused with good capillary refill.
32217,He has no ulcers or gangrene.
32218,From a cardiac standpoint Chris is doing well.
32219,He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs.
32220,It has been  years since his bypass operation
32221,and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia.
32222,While this might be controversial as to whether to do a stress test or not my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease.
32223,He requests specifically we do this study here
32224,so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI and certainly will forward you the results.
32225,Otherwise Chris is doing great.
32226,We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months.
32227,We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time.
32228,If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling then we would consider further evaluation.
32229,Otherwise as long as his symptoms remain stable and his lifestyle is not terribly limited we will continue the same.
32230,Other Data    I saw him today with Vernon Galvan one of my cardiovascular fellows who have written a detailed note.
32231,We will send this along to you as well.
32232,Thanks again.

32766,Christine Olivier      MR
32767,Dear Dr. Arteaga   Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion regarding her current cardiac condition.
32768,As her history is well known to you I will repeat it briefly for our records.
32769,Mrs. Olivier is a yearold woman with a longstanding history of coronary artery disease.
32770,After several catheterizations in the s which failed to document significant coronary artery disease done for evaluation of chest pain angiogram in July of  showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she was managed medically.
32771,However she suffered a nonQ wave myocardial infarction on February of  at which time she underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary artery disease and therefore underwent a multivessel coronary bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA D and obtuse marginal branch.
32772,She underwent repeat catheterization in February of  at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.
32773,She underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of  because of a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a  proximal LAD stenosis a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch and a  stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
32774,The saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site a saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.
32775,The left intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete stenoses.
32776,Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of .
32777,She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft to her diagonal artery.
32778,She tolerated this uneventfully and was      Olivier Christine MR                                 July     discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest discomfort.
32779,Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild exertional dyspnea.
32780,She has undergone extensive pulmonary evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which have revealed an FEV of . which is  predicted and an FVC of . which is also  predicted giving her a pattern consistent with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.
32781,In addition she has a history of a seizure disorder diabetes hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.

32815,She denies any active chest discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at alleviating the chest pain syndrome.
32816,The records available to me indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an exacerbation of her angina.
32817,However now that she is status post her PTCA
32818,it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker reduction and therefore I suggested she decrease her atenolol to
32819,mg po q.d.
32820,She will have her blood pressure checked within the next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic I will     Olivier Christine MR                                 July     also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral edema and in part because she may no longer need this.
32821,Otherwise I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur.
32822,I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem appropriate.

32872,In addition I will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated hemoglobin.
32873,It is certainly possible that her fatigue and generalized sense of lack of energy is from a noncardiac cause.

32912,Re  Christine Olivier      MR    Dear Dr. Arteaga   Mrs. Olivier returns for followup.
32913,Since last seen she reports return in a nonexertional left shoulder discomfort syndrome occasionally associated with mild dyspnea.
32914,Of note she underwent a dobutamine MIBI stress test last June for evaluating a similar syndrome and at that time she developed her typical chest and left back pain syndrome in association with no diagnostic EKG changes at a peak heart rate of  peak blood pressure of .
32915,A simultaneously obtained SESTA MIBI scan revealed a global left ventricular fraction of  a nonQwave myocardial infarction involving  out of  segments of the inferior wall and minimal periinfarct ischemia.
32916,In addition a venous duplex ultrasound study done to evaluate her severe left greater than right peripheral edema showed no evidence of DVT.
32917,Currently she remains on a regimen of amlodipine  mg poqd atenolol

32927,The neck is supple with JVP flat.

32940,Re
32941,Christine Olivier      MR      evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST and T wave changes.
32942,Compared with the last electrocardiogram there has been no significant change.
32943,Presently Mrs. Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left shoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her prebypass surgery angina.
32944,In this setting a dobutamine stress test performed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia.
32945,I have spent some time discussing with Ms. Olivier our various therapeutic and diagnostic options.
32946,She made it quite clear that she would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time and furthermore was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility should she require it of either mechanical or surgical re vascularization.
32947,It is not entirely clear to me that her left shoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin and she certainly understands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities.
32948,I have suggested that she discuss that further with you.
32949,In the meantime I have asked her as her back and chest discomfort syndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for bed to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the morning.
32950,She will call me within the next several days to report how this helps her discomfort syndrome.
32951,I do not believe that she is having GERD to explain her symptoms.
32952,In light of her reluctance to undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies I will try to tailor her antiischemic medications to minimize her chest discomfort syndrome.
32953,I of course will keep you fully informed as to her progress and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care.

33083,The following tests were abnormal or require followup.
33084,PSA.
33085,As we discussed during our visit this is a blood test that measures activity in your prostate and is one way to measure your potential risk of prostate cancer.
33086,This is not a perfect test and its use for prostate cancer screening is controversial.
33087,My records indicate that your PSA has mildly increased since .
33088,I recommend that you followup with a urologist for a prostate biopsy which we can arrange when you return for your followup appointment.
33089,At that time we will again discuss the specifics of the PSA test and the risksbenefits of different treatmentfollowup options.

33408,Oroville AL      Dear Dr. Knapp
33409,It was our pleasure to care for Mr. Osborne to help with his decompensated heart failure.
33410,He was admitted on  one month after previous admission for abdominal pain.
33411,In retrospect that admission may have been related in part to GI symptoms of heart failure.
33412,He came in complaining of continued GI discomfort orthopnea lower extremity edema and  pounds of weight gain with increasing abdominal girth.
33413,His medications at the time of admission included betablockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension with no diuretics.
33414,During his hospitalization he underwent .
33415,kilograms of diuresis with resolution of his jugular venous pressure from approximately  cm to  cm.
33416,His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately  with LV dimension of . enlarged right ventricle with mild decrease in RV function but severe RV pressure overload with estimated PA pressure  plus the right atrial pressure.
33417,After he had his diuresis he underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of  pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of  PA pressure of .
33418,He underwent a trial with IV nitroglycerin then with sildenafil.
33419,The IV nitroglycerin decreased his BLANK pressures only by approximately
33420,mm
33421,but he noted a further improvement in his dyspnea.
33422,There was no clear improvement with the sildenafil in either his symptoms or hemodynamics.
33423,His cardiac output varied between .
33424,and .
33425,on all the medications.
33426,The decision was just to put him on oral nitroglycerin in addition to the other standard heart failure medications.
33427,He also underwent a MIBI looking for any evidence of active ischemia which there was none.
33428,At the time of discharge he is walking easily without postural change or symptoms.

33448,We have emphasized not only the salt restriction but also a fluid restriction to  liters a day which includes all fluids
33449,We would encourage him to resume his daily exercise such as walking.
33450,He has an appointment to see Dr. Anderson on  and is looking forward to returning to your care.

34428,Mr Isenberg is a  yo gentleman one week out from attempted placement of right subclavian pacemaker complicated by brief arterial puncture prompt removal of the arterial catheter and successful compression.
34429,Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
34430,A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as      Hematoma around right subclavian artery.
34431,Narrowing of the artery.
34432,Apparent filling defect most likely artifactual.
34433,If thrombus is of clinical concern upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained.
34434,On physical examination he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall.
34435,His right hand is warm and well perfused with  radial and brachial pulses.
34436,There are no thrills or bruits.
34437,My review of arterial components of the CT show the following  .
34438,Hematoma to be expected  .
34439,Diffuse arterial calcifications obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.
34440,.
34441,Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.
34442,.
34443,Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.
34444,Based on his clinical exam and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order.
34445,This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
34446,If there is an intraarterial filling defect I would not pursue it.
34447,He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable.
34448,There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.

34570,The patient has a PETCT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.
34571,To my initial evaluation there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.
34572,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN      .
34573,Mr. Danny Nielson is a yearold gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.
34574,This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.
34575,I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.
34576,I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.
34577,This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.
34578,These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.
34579,I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.
34580,The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a lowgrade lymphoma.
34581,However the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a highergrade process.
34582,I feel that his leftsided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.
34583,However further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.
34584,I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.
34585,.
34586,Cardiovascular
34587,I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.
34588,If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline it would be important to have Cardiology on board.
34589,He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.
34590,The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.
34591,In followup Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.
34592,At that point we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.
34593,At that point we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.
34594,The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.
34595,Sincerely

34606,ID Mr. Nielson is a  yoM w Stage IIIB diffuse large Bcell lymphoma sp  cycles of CHOP and  cycle of RICE who presents now for cycle  of RICE.
34607,HPI   Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.
34608,He also developed bl groin swelling greater on the left the swelling in the left groin was tender.
34609,He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a .
34610,cm inguinal node a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space adenopathy in the external iliac chain largest .
34611,cm and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta.
34612,He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping.
34613,Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal Bcell populations and an inverted CDCD T Cell ratio with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.
34614,The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness.
34615,PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass improvement in lymphadenopathy and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.
34616,It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.
34617,The patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July.
34618,PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.
34619,The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass.
34620,Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on  for consideration of autoSCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen.
34621,Due to the patients age and consideration of riskbenefit it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first.
34622,Mr. Nielson was admitted on  to receive his first cycle of RICE with dosereduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of ho nephrectomy.
34623,He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.
34624,Patient felt the RICE regimen was a little    harder    on him than the CHOP regimen.
34625,He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.
34626,On  he was given  units of packed red cells due to anemia and on  he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia.
34627,He was initially scheduled to receive cycle  of RICE on  but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.
34628,He says that he currently feels coldintolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.
34629,He denies any recent NV diarrhea constipation lightheadedness orthostatic dizziness hematuria BRBPR or melena.
34630,Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness coldintolerance and constipation.

34788,Danny Nielson   MAH    DATE OF VISIT
34789,November      REASON FOR VISIT
34790,Mr. Nielson is a yearold gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B cell nonHodgkin s lymphoma who is status post four cycles of CHOPR chemotherapy with persistent disease documented by PET and biopsy.
34791,He underwent salvage with two cycles of RICE and unfortunately continued to have PET avidity in the area.
34792,As a result we scheduled him to begin therapy with Zevalin next Monday.
34793,He is here for a follow up physical and count check to make sure he has adequate platelets for this immunotherapy.
34794,INTERVAL HISTORY
34795,He describes an episode approximately one week ago of sudden onset of shortness of breath and tightness in his chest.
34796,He sat down for approximately  minutes it resolved and has not recurred since then.
34797,However we also have the reports of a follow up PETCT scan which was performed yesterday which show a new accumulation of bilateral pleural effusions which the radiologist feels are most consistent with heart failure.
34798,In addition the scans also showe the prior area of PET avidity in the leg continues although less avid.
34799,This area is in the medial compartment of the left thigh within the adductor muscles.
34800,Mr. Nielson is not excited about this.
34801,In addition we also have results from laboratories today which show his platelets at
34802,so
34803,he is not eligible to begin Zevalin next week.

34826,ASSESSMENTPLAN      Given his current status we have decided to transfer him to the emergency department today for further evaluation of his cardiac symptoms particularly to rule out myocardial infarction and assess whether he is indeed in new heart failure
34827,We attempted to contact cardiology for an outpatient evaluation but we were unable to do so.
34828,Therefore he will be transported to the emergency department for an emergent workup of his new symptoms.
34829,I suspect he will be admitted.
34830,Hopefully they will be able to get his cardiac issues under control.
34831,Unfortunately from an oncologic point of view it is uncertain whether his platelet count will reach at least  in order to give this man therapy.
34832,As a potential other therapy we will discuss the ability of radiation oncology to increase the number of cGy to that local area considering he only received  at the onset.

35032,Bilateral right greater than left carpal tunnel syndrome.
35033,HISTORY
35034,This is a first office visit for this yearold righthanddominant founder of Bed Bath and Beyond who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.
35035,The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain paresthesias and numbness on the right worse than left hand.
35036,This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.
35037,Also bothers him during prolonged activity.
35038,He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch grasp and fine motor function.
35039,Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.
35040,He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.
35041,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
35042,Glucose intolerance history of previous CVA status post CABG hypertension GER.
35043,MEDICATIONS
35044,Lopressor Zocor Ecotrin Effexor and Nexium.
35045,ALLERGIES
35046,None.
35047,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
35048,On examination today he is very pleasant well appearing in no apparent distress.
35049,Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.
35050,There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and  very weak opponens.
35051,He has a positive Tinels positive Phalens and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.
35052,His interossei and extensors are full.
35053,Sensation is intact throughout.
35054,EMG studies from  performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.
35055,IMPRESSION
35056,The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.
35057,At this time we feel that Larry has indeed a significant right worse than left bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.
35058,Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting he has difficulty with abductor pollicis we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as  possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.
35059,We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.
35060,We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.
35061,We filled out both history and physical as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

35328,Urania Yerger       MR      Dear Dr. Dillon
35329,I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first  time in Titonka Care Center in followup of her  coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in  October of this year.
35330,Though you know her history
35331,well I will  recount it for the purposes of record keeping.
35332,Ms. Yerger is  presently  years old.
35333,Her vascular risk factors include  diabetes hypertension dyslipidemia.
35334,She had no prior diagnosis  of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash  pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small nonST  elevation myocardial infarction.
35335,Coronary angiography at the  Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD  thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent  complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal  as well as a  osteal stenosis of a large PLV.
35336,Angiography also  revealed a  left renal artery stenosis.
35337,The patient underwent  subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed  by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.
35338,SVG to  ramus OM RCA and LIMA to LAD.
35339,Ms. Yergers postoperative  course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient  episode of atrial fibrillation.
35340,Since her discharge she has been slowly increasing her level of  activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending  shopping trips.
35341,Overall these symptoms have continued to improve.
35342,She denies orthopnea PND or shortness of breath at rest.
35343,She has  had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein  graft harvesting.
35344,She denies palpitations presyncope TIA CVA  symptoms or claudication.
35345,Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.
35346,Ms.  Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on  her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a  possible viral exanthem.
35347,Yerger Urania  MR                            December
35348,Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency  baseline creatinine  vascular risk factors as delineated and  prior right knee replacement.
35349,Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin
35350,mg po q.  day
35351,Lasix

35358,atorvastatin
35359,mg po q.  day Avandia multivitamins Protonix and Nystatin cream.
35360,Social History
35361,The patient lives alone but has many family  members in the area.
35362,She is currently staying with her daughter.
35363,At baseline she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but  is limited by chronic knee pain.
35364,She denies alcohol or tobacco  use.
35365,Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age .
35366,On physical exam Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.
35367,She is  comfortable seated on the exam table.
35368,Her skin is warm and dry.
35369,She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly  on her extremities.
35370,Her blood pressure is  her heart rate  is in the s.
35371,She has no jugular venous distention.
35372,Her  carotids are  without bruits.
35373,Her chest reveals decreased breath  sounds at the left base.
35374,There are no crackles or wheezes.
35375,Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and  rhythm S S and S is present and P is slightly increased.
35376,There was a grade IIVI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the  apex.
35377,Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
35378,Her extremities are free  of cyanosis or clubbing.
35379,Distal pulses are .
35380,She has mild edema  of the left lower extremity.
35381,Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm  beats per minute normal axis and  intervals persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.
35382,Overall Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after  her nonST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid  October.
35383,Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to  persistent pleural effusion.
35384,We will reevaluate today with a  repeat chest xray.
35385,In the meantime I think that we should  continue her oral diuretic regimen.
35386,It is possible that her  persistent rash is related to her Lasix.
35387,Although not certain to  be successful we have made a change to Bumex
35388,mg po q. day today  in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may  resolve.
35389,I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.
35390,We  will continue aspirin beta blockade ACE inhibition and statin for  secondary prevention.
35391,I look forward to seeing her again in  approximately eight to twelve weeks.
35392,In addition she will follow  up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis
35393,if she has a  persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her  symptoms.
35394,Yerger Urania  MR
35395,December

35570,yo F with CAD DM CHF Htn HL and right ankle fracture sp ORIF on  who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus now sp ID of the open medial malleolus wound we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.
35571,The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.
35572,If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires  weeks of antibiotics.
35573,However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware then this represents osteomyelitis by definition and she will need  weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.
35574,After discussion with the ortho resident it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.
35575,Thus we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.
35576,Thus  weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.
35577,We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.
35578,Thus would pursue  week course of therapy then monitor closely for signs of failure.

35749,I once again have strongly encouraged her to  make an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in  extensive weight reduction.
35750,I also discussed with her my  concerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral  edema particularly as it pertains both to her weight and atrial  or tachyarrhythmias.
35751,As in the past she told me that she would  refuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other  studies.
35752,She did however agree to continue with her current  medical regimen.
35753,I obtained routine blood studies today to  verify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.
35754,I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter her nurse practitioner who  will assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he  next few weeks.

35855,Cardinal Circle
35856,Three Rivers NM      Dear Dr. Taylor    Mrs. Joshi returns to the office for routine followup.
35857,Since last seen she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn.
35858,By doing so her creatinine fell from .
35859,to . and BUN from  to .
35860,She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor.
35861,In addition as part of her followup last March she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of  peak blood pressure of  stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol.
35862,Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of  with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall.
35863,Her reststress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia.
35864,Her last echocardiogram performed in July  showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at  with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis.
35865,In addition at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March .
35866,Currently she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet.
35867,Presently she continues on a regimen of ToprolXL .

35884,The neck is supple.
35885,JVP is flat.

35887,Chest remains clear.
35888,Cardiac exam shows normal S physiologically split S with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base.
35889,No significant diastolic murmur or rub.
35890,The abdomen is overweight but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit.
35891,Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.
35892,Peripheral pulses are detectable albeit mildly diminished.
35893,Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately  seconds.
35894,There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and Twave changes.
35895,Compared with her last electrocardiogram her heart rate at times is slower.
35896,Impression
35897,Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective however I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia.
35898,I have asked her to decrease her ToprolXL to
35899,mg p.o.
35900,daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so.
35901,I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness.
35902,She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future.
35903,Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of
35904,she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you and in January normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of  and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of  triglyceride of  HDL  and LDL .
35905,She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a lowsaturated fat lowcholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy.
35906,She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency.
35907,In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor.
35908,At the present time she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing.
35909,Other than reducing her betablocker regimen as described above I have not further altered her current medical program.
35910,I thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
35911,Sincerely yours

36210,I confirm that I have  interviewed and examined the patient reviewed the residents  documentation on the patients chart and discussed the  evaluation plan of care and disposition with the patient.
36211,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
36212,This is a yearold male with a  history of cough and pleuritic type chest pain.
36213,The patient  denies any nausea or vomiting.
36214,He does have history of MI as  well as multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.
36215,He  also reports lower extremities swelling worse than usual and has  left greater than right edema at baseline due to a reconstructive  surgery following motor vehicle collision.
36216,Of note the  patients medications include Coumadin which he is on for atrial  fibrillation.
36217,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
36218,The patient is awake alert and in no  distress.
36219,His vital signs show heart rate of  respiratory  rate of  blood pressure  and oxygen saturation  on  room air and  on  liters.
36220,His lungs are clear and heart is  irregularly irregular.
36221,This is somewhat limited due to body  habitus.
36222,The abdomen is soft and there is a chronic left upper  quadrant tenderness.
36223,The back shows left CVA tenderness.
36224,LABORATORY DATA
36225,The laboratory analysis shows a hematocrit of  .
36226,and a white blood cell count of ..
36227,Cardiac biomarkers are  negative and the troponin is less than ..
36228,A ddimer is less  than .
36229,The INR is ..
36230,UA is pending.
36231,ECG shows an atrial  fibrillation with some nonspecific Twave changes in leads V  through V.
36232,IMAGING
36233,STUDIES
36234,A chest radiograph was a markedly limited due  to patients habitus.
36235,DECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE
36236,There was no  clear etiology to the patients shortness of breath.
36237,Given his  anticoagulation and a negative ddimer we feel that this is  unlikely to be PE.
36238,It is clearly possible to be cardiac given  the history of coronary artery disease and a slightly abnormal  electrocardiogram.
36239,This may be pneumonia and the chest xray is  not terribly helpful.
36240,We are obtaining a CT scan of the chest  without IV contrast to better delineate the pulmonary  architecture and are admitting the patient to the Medicine  Service for monitoring and cycling of enzymes and ECGs.
36241,DIAGNOSES  .
36242,Shortness of breath.
36243,.
36244,Twave inversions on electrocardiogram.

36855,KLEIN Michelle    MRN     DOB
36856,Dear Dr. Keller
36857,Ms. Klein was seen in general neurology clinic today following her recent admission for complex migraine.
36858,Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the workup and treatment plan.
36859,We spent greater than  of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.
36860,HPI
36861,As you know Ms. Klein is a  yo RH woman with history of HTN hyperlipidemia CAD sp LAD stent  migraine who was in her USOH until the afternoon of  when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty expressing myself while cooking lunch for she and her husband.
36862,This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull L frontotemporal headache that persisted for several hours.
36863,She states she did not have wordfinding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.
36864,In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors.
36865,The episode came on suddenly and lasted  hours before she resolved back to baseline.
36866,In addition to headache associated symptoms included generalized weakness feeling cold and mildly nauseated.
36867,She denied visual changes chest pain sob palpitations lightheadedness vertigo difficulty with swallowing coordination or gait.
36868,She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low without apparent effect.
36869,She recalled one similar episode   years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home
36870,and she went to bed.
36871,The speech difficulty had resolved by morning and she apparently never told her physician or had any further workup.
36872,She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur xyear last  minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma    jagged horizontal lines    associated with nauseaphotophobia and relieved by sleep.
36873,Given her multiple vascular risk factors she was admitted for TIA workup which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbAc . including lipids ESR homocysteine lipoprotein a TTE and holter.
36874,CTCTa and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis.
36875,She was discharged on her home medications which included ASA mg po qd with a diagnosis of complex migraine.
36876,Since return home she has had additional typical episodes of migraine about every  weeks without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital.
36877,She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently with good results.
36878,ROS
36879,Sometimes    sees stars    when she stands up too quickly after bending over.
36880,Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning    I rock   .
36881,She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CTCTa.

36946,Impression and Recommendations   yo RH woman with history of HTN hyperlipidemia CAD sp LAD stent  migraine sp recent episode of transient aphasia and headache thought most likely to represent complex migraine given clinical presentation and after largely unremarkable strokeTIA workup.
36947,Since discharge she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of  xmonth.
36948,At this point we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent.
36949,Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every  days.
36950,We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIAstroke thus we have urged to continue to take unusual nonstereotyped deficits seriously.
36951,She will followup with us in  months or sooner if the need arises.
36952,Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.
36953,We look forward to seeing her in followup.
36954,Sincerely   Olen X. Laughlin M.D. Neurology Resident Pager   I have seen and examined the patient with Dr. Laughlin resident in Neurology and repeated or observed all the key elements of the encounter before discussing the assessment and management.
36955,I agree with the information including the history examination and assessmentplan documented in this note.

37416,Date of Visit      Background
37417,Ms. Cantu is a yearold diabetic woman with longstanding hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
37418,She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease.
37419,She was initially seen in March  when she was admitted with fever nausea and chest pain.
37420,Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration.
37421,She was also noted at that time to have an ANA  speckled with positive RNP negative Scl.
37422,Clinically she had Sjogrens with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face.
37423,The Raynauds was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery .
37424,Slowly these lesions healed.
37425,Interim Issues The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled.
37426,But on exercise tolerance test she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis.
37427,In April  she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed.
37428,Recovering from surgery has been slow.
37429,But it has been steady and uncomplicated.
37430,She can now go up  flights of stairs then rest to go the third flight to her home.
37431,She has had no recurrent chest pain.
37432,She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage.
37433,She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath points anteriorly but no dyspnea per se.
37434,She healed well postoperatively.
37435,She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape.
37436,Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR.
37437,In terms of the MCTD she continues to have some Raynauds.
37438,She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands.
37439,What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis.
37440,She felt much better on
37441,mg of prednisone daily.
37442,She remains on Plaquenil
37443,mg daily.
37444,She has had no worsening swallowing.
37445,She has had no fever pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion.
37446,She sleeps on two pillows.
37447,She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth.
37448,She continues on omeprazole.

37906,M w multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction now admitted w ARF hyperkalemia anemia and a presumed UTI.
37907,His UA and UCx are not overwhelmingly cw a UTI but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations.
37908,He is being managed by ID.
37909,His ureteral stents were last changed
37910,but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction.
37911,His abdominal CT is pending.
37912,He remains clinically stable with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission.
37913,As such we recommend FU UCx and ID recs as you are doing.
37914,FU CT AP to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.
37915,Depending on the results of this study we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.
37916,Regardless of his eventual stent plan he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.

38228,Dear Dr. Huerta    Reason for visit
38229,Today I had the pleasure of seeing Irving Vera in Cardiology clinic.
38230,He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light.
38231,He is a yearold man with diabetes type  hypertension hypercholesterolemia and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in .
38232,He presented in  with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling.
38233,He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.
38234,He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then.
38235,Echocardiogram performed on  showed normal ejection fraction of  borderline left atrium at  mm and no significant valvular abnormalities.
38236,Stress test performed on  showed  minutes of exercise  METS and a peak double product of  .
38237,He had no EKG changes and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia.
38238,The patient has been managed medically since then.
38239,He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
38240,The patient has been doing well over the past several months.
38241,Currently he exercises once or twice a week by swimming  minutes in a pool.
38242,A few months ago he was exercising almost everyday.
38243,His weight has been up and down.
38244,He does not complain of any chest pain shortness of breath or other symptoms.
38245,Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse he notices a skipped beat.
38246,I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.
38247,Past medical history     Diabetes hypertension hypercholesterolemia atrial flutter as above coronary artery disease as above Bells palsy with residual left eye tearing kidney stones and glaucoma.

38289,He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in  but has not had any repeat episodes.
38290,He is currently not anticoagulated.
38291,Given new recommendations his target LDL should be less than .
38292,He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week.
38293,If his LDL is not below  then he should either be switched to Lipitor  mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen.
38294,He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of .
38295,The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male.
38296,In the office today if his blood pressure remains elevated then I will increase his lisinopril to
38297,mg a day.

38604,This is a yearold white female coming for her fu visit.
38605,The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and pituitary adenoma and  recently was hospitalized at American Legion Hospital with general malaise  syndrome and backchest pain.
38606,Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.
38607,She was found to have a blood  pressure of  systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent  headaches.
38608,She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being  found collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.
38609,She was transferred to the  Intensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonicclonic  convulsions with diazepam and lorazepam.
38610,She also suffered a urinary tract  infection in hospital treated with Cipro.
38611,She was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October    at which time she was awake but unable to give a history.
38612,On admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of   pulse was  and temperature was ..
38613,She had a myxedematous face and  was obese.
38614,She was cardiovascularly stable.
38615,Neurologically she was able to move  all four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.
38616,Cranial nerves  intact.
38617,Initially the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to  elevated blood pressure.
38618,Most likely she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy.
38619,Patient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain lumbar  puncture both of which were negative.
38620,Electroencephalogram was  performed and  showed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.
38621,The patients  alertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.
38622,She had  an episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral  leads.
38623,Acute cardiac event was ruled out.
38624,The patient underwent a course of  physical therapy and then finally was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.
38625,A  specific cause of the patients seizure was not found although it was assumed that  this might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with  use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her  threshold for seizure activity.
38626,Upon discharge the patient was in stable condition.
38627,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
38628,Remarkable for seizure type II diabetes mellitus  panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg hypertension right arm bone  tumor excision associated with right radial neuropathy and hyperlipidemia.

40454,The patient is seen in followup at the Community Health.
40455,He came back from Pennsylvania after being there about a month.
40456,He has had an eventful past six months.
40457,In October he apparently had a TIA or small stroke.
40458,He was evaluated with an MRA of his neck and was told that there was not enough blockage to warrant surgery.
40459,His symptomatology fortunately clear.
40460,His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity.
40461,About this time he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe.
40462,He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin.
40463,Not long after this he went into renal failure.
40464,He was told that they could not tell if that was due to the antibiotics or the gadolinium.
40465,According to the patient and his wife his creatinine went as high as .
40466,Fortunately it is currently back down to ..
40467,His toe lesion has been very slow to improve.
40468,He describes pain in the toe and often has to sleep in a chair with his foot dependent.
40469,He has seen various physicians and podiatrists in Pennsylvania without much improvement.
40470,They finally told him he would do well to come back here for further care and evaluation.
40471,On examination today I can feel femoral and popiteal pulses.
40472,I do not feel any definite pedal pulses on either side
40473,but noninvasive study show good pulsatile flow at the calf and transmetatarsal level.
40474,Resting ABI is good although his diabetic calcinosis probably makes this unreliable.
40475,He has some slight pulsatile flow at the right toe level and flat tracings at left toes.
40476,He has  cm escharover the dorsum of his second toe.
40477,There is some erythema of the toe and proximal dorsal forefoot.
40478,This certainly has the appearance of some cellulites.
40479,There is minimal to no swelling of the toe.
40480,We will place him on Keflex
40481,mg q.i.d.
40482,for  to  days to see if this helps with any possible associated cellulitis.
40483,I will refer him to Dr. Caldwell for recommendations regarding wound quick care and an opinion whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be worth considering.
40484,I do not think there is anything further we can do to improve his distal blood flow.
40485,Further imaging will also be very difficult in view of the possible problems with gadolinium as well as his creatinine which limit contrast administration.
40486,His noninvasive studies suggest that his problems are all diabetic small vessel disease and it is unlikely that we could be of benefit with this.
40487,I will await Dr. Caldwells opinions.

40635,The case was complicated by large blood loss anemia and hypotension.
40636,In the PACU the patient continued to be hypotensive and have low uop.
40637,We placed a central line starting CVP was  and continued resuscitation.
40638,The patient developed ST changes and also had acute on chronic renal failure RIFLE F. WE transfused and transferred him to the ICU.

40641,I agree with history and exam as outlined in residents note
40642,Issues Cardiac ischemia
40643,Ischemia was mostly due to hypotension and low HGB as well as tachycardia .
40644,Will give aspirin and lower HR to s with Beta blockers.

40646,Willt ransfuse to HGB around  and continue to check troponins
40647,Decreased myocardial function he has low central venous saturation and increased lactate .
40648,Will give fluids and transfuse the patient.
40649,Will get echo in am.
40650,If his central venous sat  and lactate does not signficantly improve with these measures would stay away from inotropes for now given his rate related ischemia   Acute bloodloss naemia will transfuse to    Metabolic acidosis the patetin has signifcant metabolic acidosis.
40651,We will for now give volume.

41041,This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.
41042,Although there were no   CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.
41043,Consider Ddimer to rule out recent PE.
41044,Ischemia   EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x does not suggest this.
41045,However Pt   has not had any acute Sx while on the floor.
41046,PNA
41047,This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.
41048,Tumor

41052,PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs and the onset was not acute.
41053,The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely however the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.
41054,PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.
41055,Will start the Pt on O in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics betablockers and ACEI.
41056,Will consider the addition of spironolactone.
41057,Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.
41058,Order LFTs to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.
41059,Monitor UOP for kidney functions.
41060,Monitor EKG for any changes.
41061,Will send for a Ddimer to ro recent PE.
41062,HTN  Poorly controlled may be o to missing meds today.

41076,Briefly
41077,This is a M with a hx of CAD sp MI sp AICD IDDM HTN and hyperlipidemia who presents with DOE PND and bilateral leg edema x days.
41078,DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP nausea vomiting and diaphoresis although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.
41079,Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP absence of crackles
41080,SEM at LLSB and apex and mild symmetric pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
41081,Per chart notes in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.
41082,Favor CHF pacer malfunction ischemia  PE.
41083,CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest Lsided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data no crackles on exam CXR clear to suggest this.
41084,Prior to our evaluation he received  of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter with subjective improvement which may account for this discrepancy.
41085,Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function pacer interrogation and stress.
41086,Ddimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a lowprob possibility.

42054,Record date       NAME     Hendrickson Ora   MRN
42055,This patient is here for a followup.
42056,She was seen with a very complete evaluation   by Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.
42057,She submitted a  urine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her  urine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.
42058,A fair amount retained  as postvoid residual.
42059,Ms. Hendrickson completed her  days of Levaquin with  resolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor  and cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.
42060,She  has anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent  infections.
42061,She is most concerned about having cancer.
42062,She is scheduled to see Dr.
42063,Quezada March th.
42064,The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have
42065,been issues going around the housing projects.
42066,A yearold girl was raped and  one week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment.
42067,She ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.
42068,She did not file a  police report.
42069,As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.
42070,She  reports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix  approximately one week ago.
42071,She had been taking
42072,mg onehalf to one tablet  sporadically but not on a regular basis.
42073,She denies any chest pressure or  palpitations.
42074,She denies any shortness of breath.
42075,She denies any problems with  pain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.

42083,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN        Hypertension.
42084,Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.
42085,This       may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.

42087,mg to take onehalf tablet q.d.
42088,on a regular       basis.

42093,She was given another prescription for Levaquin
42094,mg one PO q.d.
42095,She       will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.
42096,I attempted to       reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current       recurrent infections.
42097,It is more likely due to her cystocele.
42098,Peripheral vascular disease.
42099,This appears stable.
42100,She remains off the       cigarettes.
42101,ASCVD.

42629,She went to a hospital there  in her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive  troponin.
42630,She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did  show multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.
42631,She subsequently  underwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.
42632,She did  have recurrent chest pain today after catheterization which was  much more severe sharper in nature per her description.
42633,She was  told in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.
42634,She returned home today called her primary care physician and  was advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation.

42962,Grayling ME
42963,Dear Fitzgerald      I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Haden Doty in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease.
42964,As you know he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease for which I ended up doing a catheterization on  and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.
42965,At that time he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia a low workload of  minutes and  seconds and a heart rate of only  of predicted.
42966,The LV chamber was dilated and the ejection fraction was estimated at  and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.
42967,The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree some calcification and narrow caliber vessels overall but no focal highgrade stenoses.
42968,There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.
42969,He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.
42970,At the time of his cath he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.
42971,That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side a small superior one that was narrowed by about  and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about .
42972,The right side was patent.
42973,With respect to the abdominal aorta there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery narrowing the channel in the aorta by about  or .
42974,The iliac vessels were patent and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.
42975,The left SFA a diffusely diseased vessel had a highgrade stenosis of about  in the adductor canal.
42976,Then at the trifurcation there was occlusion or highgrade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.
42977,There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.
42978,The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively at least for the present since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.
42979,He also apparently had some other issues so I never saw him again in followup.
42980,The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.
42981,He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.
42982,Dr. Anders Sykes performed an LL LL decompressive laminectomy.
42983,This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.
42984,The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.
42985,He has been an avid golfer in the past but is now having some more difficulty with that.
42986,Even when I saw him two years ago he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.
42987,He still is able to play golf but if he walks about  yards he starts feeling his calves and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.
42988,He also has some numbness in his toes which is constant and his feet feel cold much of the time.
42989,The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.
42990,His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.
42991,He tells me that you get pressures of .
42992,He has not been taking his blood pressure at home but he does take a fair amount of medication see below.
42993,Of note his son says that when he was in Michigan he was playing  holes of golf regularly sometimes a couple of times per day but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.
42994,He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.
42995,He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move and if he does not play any golf at all he will really deteriorate.
42996,Of note the discomfort is not only limited to the calves but also there is some discomfort in the hips though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.
42997,Of note he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to walk walk walk.
42998,At this point he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.

44578,Given her new onset of chest pain and recent return to smoking we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in  weeks to report any change in her chest pain.
44579,If at that time the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan.
44580,We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than  for secondary prevention of strokes.
44581,We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review and will call her once these results are available to us.

44666,She however is requiring a lot of assistance with  managing her medications.
44667,She has her daughterinlaw downstairs help  her with this.
44668,She has not been out of the house much in the last  several months and while she wants to drive noone has allowed her to  get behind the wheel.

44683,and most recently it was  .
44684,earlier this week.
44685,She will continue on her current medications  as noted above.
44686,The bulk of the discussion was regarding her home situation and her  mental status.
44687,She has clearly improved her mental status gradually  over the last several months.
44688,She is anxious to drive.
44689,However  everyone in the family who is with her at the visit and her visiting  nurse agree that she is not mentally sound enough to be behind a wheel.
44690,I explained this in no uncertain terms and also set a milestone in  management of her own medications.
44691,Hence our three goals that we set  today were .
44692,Management of the patients own medications which she was doing       six months ago. .
44693,To get out of the house at least once a week using either       community transportation or a family member. .
44694,To be doing the familys laundry each week.
44695,While the patient was not happy about being told that she could not
44696,drive she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that  we set.
44697,Hence I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing  with these goals.
44698,As well we will continue to have the visiting nurse  see her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.

44735,I will  not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin AC.
44736,I  suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica but I  would rather wait because of her anticoagulation and to see whether it  remits on its own.

44765,I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization  where she had a pneumonia a right middle lobe which was successfully  treated with levofloxacin.
44766,MEDICATIONS

44778,Page
44779,The patient was brought to me today by her family because they were  concerned that she was not getting optimal care.
44780,In talking to her she  says she feels quite well.
44781,She has no pain.
44782,She has no pain in her  buttocks or her legs.
44783,She says her breathing feels well.
44784,She has no  productive cough.
44785,She has no chest pain.
44786,She denies any peripheral  edema.
44787,She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough  exercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home but otherwise feels like she  is getting reasonable care.
44788,However she does breakdown and cry about  her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing  home.
44789,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
44790,On the exam today her blood pressure is .
44791,She has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of .
44792,She  has sharp clicks over her chest.
44793,She has a soft abdomen with no  organomegaly and a well healed scar.
44794,She has equal pulses bilaterally.
44795,She has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags.
44796,She has a full  range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips knees and  ankles.
44797,She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and
44798,she seems relatively stable.
44799,She is somewhat confused about the date and  the place but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly  about her current situation at Elm Hills.
44800,I have no laboratory data to speak of.
44801,I had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son  and daughterinlaw and explained my concerns with
44802,her overall safety
44803,and I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an  unsupervised setting.
44804,I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable  place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an  antidepressant.
44805,It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her  recently and I think it would be worthwhile at least a month trial of  SSRI gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects.
44806,I am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance
44807,but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact  me with questions about her past history.

44825,Mr. Quijano returned for followup today.
44826,His last visit was in December  following which he had a routine stress test.
44827,He had been planning to do some skiing over January and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.
44828,His stress test was done on  and revealed mild apical ischemia.
44829,He completed  METs and had no symptoms during the test.
44830,Based on these findings we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.
44831,Unfortunatley he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.
44832,He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring rarely but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol.
44833,The frequency of these episodes has increased to  times per week.
44834,He says it is not really shortness of breath but an awareness that something feels different.
44835,He is able to continue his usual activities including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.

45376,For his increasing angina he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.
45377,He then had a left brachial artery.
45378,Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a  distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.
45379,There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main but the documentation of this was not clear.
45380,With the complexity of his anatomy he is referred for further evaluation.
45381,He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago does not drink alcohol.
45382,He is married and lives in Missouri.

45482,This is a  year old male with a hx of CAD sp CABG  who was referred on  from renal Dr. Turk Elvis at the Central Buffalo Hospital to Dr. Judge at BHCC for rapidly progressive renal impairment.
45483,He is an arteriopath with occluded aorta beneath the levels of renal arteries as revealed in recent MRA.
45484,In the past an attempted femoral artery cannulation was proved unsuccessful due to above reason.
45485,Subsequently he underwent two cardiac angiograms thro left brachial and Rt radial arterial route.
45486,His creatinine has risen from baseline of .
45487,Nov  post CABG to . may .
45488,He denies taking any NSAIDS.
45489,He thinks that he was started on Altace post surgery but was not sure about that fact.
45490,Dr. Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides.
45491,Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogramangioplasty thro radial artery route Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty.
45492,He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin Indn AF inview of potential angioplasty.
45493,He complains of claudication pains in both legs with left legRt leg.
45494,He experiences pain on exertion on left calf thigh and buttock.

45560,PLAN .
45561,His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici BHCC IR department.
45562,Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys.
45563,Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys.
45564,Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery.
45565,Both kidneys appeared normal in size . and . cm.
45566,Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.
45567,.
45568,We have requested Dr.Xi Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future.
45569,If so whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys.
45570,We are awaiting his expert opinion.
45571,.
45572,Patient realises that renal angiogram  angioplasty thro radial artery carries its own risk.
45573,Risks of Cholesterol emboli Contrast nephropathy arterial injury risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained.
45574,However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.
45575,.
45576,We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.
45577,.
45578,If patient is going for IR renal
45579,angiogramplasty
45580,then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.
45581,We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xis opinon.
45582,DONNIE YOUNGMAN MB MRCPENG P    Renal Staff
45583,I have seen and examined the patient twice today and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology
45584,In essence I agree with Dr Youngmans recs.
45585,Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
45586,He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.
45587,His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.
45588,His options are  conservative approach and likely ESRD in the coming weeks
45589,Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
45590,Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication
45591,We are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will dw patient tomorrow.

45593,Date of Consultation June    ID  year old male from Missouri Reason for Consult Perioperative consultation prior to aortobifemoral bypass surgery
45594,History of Present Illness
45595,This  year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery.
45596,Over the last several months he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain
45597,he describes primarily left leg burning thigh calf when he walks coming on over about  yards.
45598,If he pushes further he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution.
45599,He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past  monts .
45600,.
45601,Based on noninvasive imaging this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis.
45602,His ACEI ramipril has  been held without improvement.
45603,A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday.
45604,There was an  proximal right RA stenosis and a  left RA stenosis perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr.
45605,The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta below the renal arteries the SMA is patent.
45606,An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.
45607,He has had reduced functional capacity for some time.
45608,He gets claudication within  yards but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea.
45609,He complains also of orthopnea  pillows PND as well as bilateral LE edema.
45610,He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.
45611,He is avoiding salt but not fluid restricting.
45612,His lasix dose has not changed.
45613,He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.

45675,This gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded CHF and hypertensive this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.
45676,The issues include Congestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.
45677,I would consider increasing his diuretic eg.
45678,Lasix
45679,mg iv bid to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic.
45680,Hopefully this will work if not he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation.
45681,He will be at high risk of CHF postop and likely will need an ICU bed consider starting hydralazinenitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACEinhibitor for afterload reduction consider a preop echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS Prevention of periperative MI
45682,He should continue his ASA atenolol statinszetia
45683,perioperatively
45684,No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is
45685,LV function on echo is markedly reduced recent CABG no angina Even with best medical care for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications roughly
45686,Prevention of perioperative AF Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively Restart coumadin postop for stroke prevention long term Endocarditis prophylaxis He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve
45687,We will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failurefluid overload prior to surgery.

45738,The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and Twave abnormalities.
45739,Sinus bradycardia min.
45740,First degree AVB STRESS ECG No ST segment changes were observed during this test.
45741,Arrhythmias None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia.
45742,However the sensitivity of Adenosineinduced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited.
45743,SCAN RESULTS
45744,The left ventricle is normal in size.
45745,There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest.
45746,The left ventricular ejection fraction was  on the stress study.
45747,Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study.
45748,CONCLUSIONS The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia.
45749,The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemiaLVEF.

46093,Comparison MRI spine dated .
46094,Procedure Multiplanar MR imaging of the entire spine was  performed without and with Gadolinium.
46095,Findings
46096,There is an old compression fracture at T.
46097,There is exaggeration  of the normal kyphosis at this level.
46098,There is no evidence of  marrow edema to suggest acute fracture in the spine.

46116,The differential diagnosis includes cord  infarction and demyelinating disease.
46117,Vascular malformation and
46118,neoplasm are considered less likely due to the absence of vascular  flow voids and abnormal enhancement.
46119,MRA  MRA of the aorta with runoff was conducted as per departmental  protocol.
46120,FINDINGS
46121,Due to the nature of MRI imaging dedicated sequences were  performed to evaluate the vasculature.

46554,Manatee Street Post IN
46555,Dear Dr. Null
46556,I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in followup of his recent admission to the ICMA.
46557,While I know that you are familiar with his history please allow me to briefly review it for my records.
46558,He is a lovely  year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins status post mantle radiation in the early s coronary artery disease status postPCI to the LAD and RCA in  and  respectively and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.
46559,MIBI done at LMC  showed normal EF without perfusion defects no scar or ischemia he exercised  on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.
46560,He was admitted  for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer ASA was stopped  week prior to surgery he was not on plavix preop in PACU following resection he had a VTVF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA.
46561,After extensive suction catheter use and POBA a good angiographic result was obtained no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.
46562,Remarkably echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function with basal inferoposterior HK noted.
46563,His peak TnI was .
46564,his peak CK was  and his peak MB was ..
46565,He had a relatively unremarkable course postcatheterization plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed after which it was started without incident.
46566,He was discharged  and returns today for routine followup.
46567,Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy but will be closely followed.
46568,Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins he is followed at RFPC and is due for an annual visit there in the next  months.
46569,He has been walking outside for the past  weeks since the weather improved walking about  miles in around  minutes.
46570,He feels well and has had no problems.
46571,He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion climbing hills but denies any unusual dyspnea.
46572,He denies chest pain SOB at rest orthopnea stable  pillow use PND edema palpitaitons or claudication.
46573,He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics  his BP runs in the ss with rare systolics in the s.
46574,His heart rate has been in the s.
46575,His past medical history includes  CAD sp IMI  totally occluded RCA with good collaterals revascularized with  stents to the RCA MI  LAD stent inferior STEMI  as above sp POBA  VF arrest in setting of STEMI
46576,Hodgkins   splenectomy XRT
46577,LUL squamous cell cancer sp L upper lobectomy   hyperlipidemia low HDL and high LDL  tried niaspan in the past without much benefit  hypothyroid  basal cell skin
46578,CA  nephrolithiasis
46579,His medications include
46580,Lipitor  mg
46581,Plavix  mg
46582,ASA
46583,mg po QD
46584,Lopressor
46585,mg po BID
46586,Prilosec  mg
46587,He has a history of intolerance dizziness with lisinopril.
46588,His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension but negative for CAD.
46589,He works in consulting and travels around the Midwest as part of his job.
46590,He is now back at work.
46591,He is married and lives in Lincoln City.
46592,He and his wife have  children ages        they have no pets.
46593,He has never smoked cigarettes.
46594,He drinks  glasses of wineweek and a cup of coffee qam.
46595,On physical exam today he has a heart rate of  and a blood pressure of .
46596,He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
46597,His JVP is flat sitting at  degrees and he has no carotid bruits.
46598,His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
46599,He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S S and no murmurs rubs or gallups.
46600,His abdomen is benign.
46601,He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema and with  PT pulses bilaterally.
46602,His EKG in clinic today is NSR at  with possible LAE a nonspeciifc IVCD and inferior Q waves in IIIF consistent with an inferior MI.
46603,He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.
46604,His recent cardiac tests include    echo   EF  basal inferoposterior HK normal atrai no significant valvular disease   cath
46605,right dominant system patent LAD stent proximal  LCx proximal  thrombotic RCA occlusion instent with  ostial RPDA thrombotic lesion sp AngiojetPOBA with TIMI excellent angiographic result
46606,In summary this is a  year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute instent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA.
46607,He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this lifethreatening event.
46608,Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.
46609,Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.
46610,Furthermore he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents
46611,we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.
46612,His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen as demonstrated by his home records.
46613,I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor  bid to toprol  bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade but otherwise would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.
46614,We will check a full set of labs today but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.
46615,Given his history of Hodgkins as well as his known CAD he is clearly at risk for future events and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.
46616,Certainly if he has any concerning symptoms we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.
46617,At present however I am delighted with how well he is doing.
46618,It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
46619,I will plan to see him in followup in  months time
46620,but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.

46669,Dear Dr. Null
46670,I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in followup for his known coronary artery disease and recent admission to Wytheville South with a nonST elevation myocardial infarction.
46671,As Im sure you recall he is a lovely  year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease statuspost mantle radiation in the early s squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy  and coronary artery disease status postPCI to the LAD and RCA in  and  respectively and perioperative VTVF arrest at the time of his LUL resection .
46672,At that time emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA with a good angiographic result.
46673,No stents were placed given the thrombus burden.
46674,Remarkably subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function with basal inferoposterior HK noted.
46675,His peak TnI was .
46676,his peak CK was  and his peak MB was ..
46677,He had a relatively unremarkable course postcatheterization plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed after which it was started without incident.
46678,He was discharged  and had done well until  when he presented to WSH with unstable angina having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk.
46679,He had a positive troponin and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization which revealed a proximal LAD lesion felt to be the culprit and ostial RCA lesion both of which were stented with CYPHER stents.
46680,At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from  to  as an attempt to maximize his medical management given his history and disease burden.
46681,Since that admission he has done exceedingly well and presents today without complaints.
46682,He continues to walk  miles  timesweek without exertional symptoms.
46683,He specifically denies chest pain dyspnea orthopnea PND or lower extremity edema.
46684,He has had no palpitations dizzinesspresyncope or claudication.
46685,He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated productssnacks with a  weight loss and is motivated to further reduce his weight.
46686,He states that he feels great and isdoing quite well.
46687,He does not that occasionally at this work when he is frustratedupset he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be
46688,but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes and his pressures are great at home.
46689,He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen despite not being on a PPI.
46690,Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy but will be closely followed.
46691,His most recent imaging was  which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor.
46692,Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis.
46693,His past medical history includes   CAD sp IMI  totally occluded RCA with good collaterals revascularized with  stents to the RCA MI  LAD stent inferior STEMI  as above sp POBA   VF arrest in setting of STEMI

46707,He has a history of intolerance dizziness with lisinopril.
46708,His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension but negative for CAD.
46709,He works in consulting and travels around the midwest as part of his job.
46710,He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering  and works as a museum docent a few times a week.
46711,He is married and lives in Lincoln City.
46712,He and his wife have  children ages        they have no pets.
46713,He has never smoked cigarettes.
46714,He drinks  glass of wine a night.
46715,On physical exam today he has a heart rate of  and a blood pressure of  with a weight of .
46716,He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
46717,His JVP is  cm he has no carotid bruits.
46718,His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
46719,He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S and a physiologically split S and no murmurs rubs or gallups.
46720,His abdomen is benign.
46721,He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema and with  PT pulses bilaterally.
46722,His EKG in clinic today is NSR at  with possible left atrial abnormality a nonspeciifc IVCD and inferior Q waves in IIIF consistent with an inferior MI.
46723,In summary this is a  year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute instent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA who represented  year later  with NSTEMI now sp PCI to his RCA and LAD.
46724,He is now asymptomatic status post this intervention
46725,Given his history we agree with antiplatelet therapy with a plan for lifelong plavix and aspirin.
46726,Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures it would be reasonable to decrease doses to  plavix ASA
46727,but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether.
46728,His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen as demonstrated by his home records.
46729,His LDL is near goal with a low HDL that was unaffected by highdose niaspan in the past.
46730,I share his hope that with further dietweight loss and exercise these will both improve to goal.
46731,As I have discussed with he and his wife given his history of Hodgkins as well as his known CAD he is clearly at risk for future events including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future.
46732,We will be guided by his symptoms and he knows to call me if he has any problemssymptoms.
46733,It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
46734,I will plan to see him in followup in  months time
46735,but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.

46741,Dear Dr. Nall
46742,It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.
46743,As you are well aware he has many coronary risk factors.
46744,He is a yearold gentleman with past history Hodgkins disease status post mantle radiation in the early s and left upper lobe lobectomy in  for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VTVF arrest.
46745,He has history of hypertension hypercholesterolemia as well as overweight.
46746,He does not have a former history of type  diabetes but on recent screening his hemoglobin Ac has been elevated at .
46747,His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to  and  when he had nonST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.
46748,He has subsequently had a VTVF arrest during his lobectomy in  which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.
46749,He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.
46750,In  he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions both which were intervened with drugeluting Cypher stents with good results.
46751,Since then he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel
46752,mg lifelong and full dose aspirin
46753,mg p.o.
46754,daily lifelong.
46755,We see him in followup today and again he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.
46756,Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working  jobs including overnight shifts which is strenuous at times.
46757,He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.
46758,He has no chest pain shortness of breath palpitations presyncope or syncope with exertion.
46759,He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
46760,He has been taking his blood pressures at home which range at about  to  with an average of .
46761,His heart rates have been in ss.
46762,He has had no side effects to his medications.
46763,He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.
46764,He says that he walks for  miles when the weather is nice but given that it has been a harsh winter he has not been doing this often.
46765,His current medications aspirin  mg p.o.
46766,daily clopidogrel

46776,His weight was  pounds his blood pressure was  in the right arm and  in the left arm with a large cuff and his heart rate was  and regular.
46777,His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.
46778,There are no bruits.
46779,His chest is clear to auscultation.
46780,He was not clubbed.
46781,His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S and S with no additional gallops rubs or murmurs.
46782,He had no peripheral edema.
46783,His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
46784,His pulses were palpable  throughout.

46795,HDL  LDL .
46796,Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of .
46797,Mild left atrial enlargement no LVH.
46798,Impression
46799,Nick is still borderline hypertensive and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.
46800,We started him on ramipril .
46801,mg today
46802,and he will increase that to
46803,mg a day after tolerating it for  weeks.
46804,He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.
46805,To simplify and decrease his betablocker regimen we switched to atenolol mg daily today.
46806,We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at
46807,mg extended release for a month
46808,and then he will increase that to
46809,g a day.
46810,He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin  about  minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.
46811,With regards to his coronary artery disease all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.
46812,Nevertheless Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.
46813,The results may not changes our current management strategy but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology particularly coronary artery thrombus as well as play a future role in familial screening.
46814,To that end we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.
46815,We have also requested a thrombophilia workup including factor V Leiden prothrombin gene mutation protein C and S levels antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.
46816,Otherwise I believe Nick is doing well.
46817,We will see him again in  months time with follow up on these studies.
46818,If by then he still has evidence of diabetes and trouble losing weight we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.
46819,He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.
46820,This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.

46828,Dear Dr. Nall
46829,It was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on  for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.
46830,As you know Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkins lymphoma and subsequently had
46831,NSTEMIs in  and .
46832,He received baremetal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until  when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMIVTVF arrest.
46833,Immediate angiography postresuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery with good result after thrombectomy and POBA in addition to Integrilin aspirin Plavix and low dose heparin.
46834,Remarkably after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event.
46835,He did well until  when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have instent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA baremetal stents.
46836,He was treated with Cypher drugeluting stents to both lesions .
46837,x
46838,mm
46839,Cypher stent post dilated to  atm to the LAD and .
46840,x
46841,mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA with no residual stenosis.
46842,Because of concerns with regards to recurrent instent
46843,restenosis
46844,he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy mg ECASA and clopidogrel
46845,mg since that event intended as longterm therapy.
46846,He has been followed by me since  with no recurrent ischemic heart disease chest pain and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.
46847,Nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland.
46848,As the economy is picking up his work environment has improved as has his stress level.
46849,He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another pounds.
46850,He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.
46851,Every year he asks whether we can downtitrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons I reassured him that it should be generic within a year.
46852,Nevertheless we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow PY PRU assay and his result was  which is below the cutoff of  PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.
46853,He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.
46854,His current medications should be aspirin
46855,mg p.o.
46856,daily clopidogrel

46874,His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits.
46875,His chest is clear to auscultation.
46876,His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops rubs or murmurs.
46877,He had no peripheral edema.
46878,His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
46879,He had  pulses in the peripheral exam.
46880,EKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at  bpm with voltage criteria for LVH LAE and prior inferior Qwaves.
46881,We are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than  mgdL.
46882,He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.
46883,His LDL last year was
46884,mgdL though HDL has improved to
46885,mgdL.
46886,His TCHDL ratio is .

46891,Impression
46892,Nick is doing well with CCS  symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in  due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.
46893,To target his coronary risk factors I recommended the following  .
46894,Should his LDL be gtmgdL he should switch to rosuvastatin
46895,mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement.
46896,.
46897,Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than  PRU he will decrease to
46898,mg daily
46899,and we will recheck his PRU activity after at least  days on this dose.
46900,Should PRU gt
46901,he will either need to restart
46902,mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel or when available ticagrelor. .
46903,He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in  months.
46904,Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.
46905,As I am not continuing a general outpatient clinic next year Nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on Saturday.

46915,History of Present Illness Pt is a  yo M sp bilateral fempop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.
46916,He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on  and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.
46917,However one week ago he sat on the floor for  hours doing electrical work flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.
46918,This lasted for  hours.
46919,He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.
46920,He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on  and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.
46921,He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L possibly secondary to graft kinking andor thrombosis and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.

47322,The  patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and  whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease for  which he suffered a silent heart attack many years ago a history of  benign prostatic hypertrophy as well as hypertension and GERD.
47323,As it  turns out the patient had been on Zantac for many many years the  beneficial effects of which were unknown.
47324,We had decided as of our last  meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.
47325,The  patient reports today that he is not symptomatic and thus we will  continue to discontinue this medicine.
47326,At this point the patient does  not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor such as Prilosec.
47327,With regard to the patients symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy  the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin since he  wanted to use up all his Minipress which he tool up until  nights ago.
47328,Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.
47329,It is  noted that his blood pressure was  which is better than it was
47330,the last time he was here which the systolic range was  and  diastolic was .
47331,The patient reports no new symptomatology other  than occasional fatigue from which he will have to rest.
47332,The patient  has no symptoms of congestive heart failure no shortness of breath no  ankle edema no JVD by observation and his laboratory results are  remarkably normal given his medical complaints.
47333,The patients  cholesterol is  with a slightly above average triglycerides.
47334,Review  of systems otherwise negative.
47335,Physical exam is not performed at this time.

47338,ASSESSMENTPLAN
47339,This is a  year old man with multiple medical  problems coming in for followup. .
47340,Hypertension
47341,the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use       Hytrin now both for his hypertension as well as benign prostatic       hypertrophy.
47342,The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling       and he said he also has urge incontinence particularly while       standing.
47343,The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin which       hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic       hypertrophy that this urge incontinency will also be helped.
47344,If       the patients symptoms continue beyond this he will be referred to       Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
47345,.
47346,BPH  please see above.
47347,The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.

47349,coronary artery disease
47350,the patients cholesterol is  with a       slightly above average triglycerides which is more than acceptable       for this gentleman.
47351,I do not have an HDL in which to judge his       ratio
47352,but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high s       MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL

47355,Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without       therapy.
47356,I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in       about  months and if there is any derangement in his profile he       will be put on an antilipid drug.
47357,.
47358,GI  at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned and what
47359,I       will attempt to do is to keep him off his H blockers at this       point.
47360,Should his symptoms return the patient most likely will be       placed on Prilosec.
47361,I will seen him in one month for followup primarily for evaluation of  his use of Hytrin.

47365,HPI  Kadeem Vicente comes in today for follow up office visit.
47366,The patient  is seen primarily for follow up regarding his history of hypertension  coronary artery disease the patient is status post inferior wall MI  benign prostatic hypertrophy and to a much lesser extent osteoarthritis.
47367,The patient is also followed GERDlike symptoms.
47368,With regard to the  latter the patient notes that since he has been off the Zantac he  initially saw no change in his ability to handle foods however he now  notes that he is starting to get some reflux and feels slightly  uncomfortable with this.
47369,He denies chest pain per se and any symptoms  pertinent to cardiovascular disease such as chest heaviness shortness  of breath diaphoresis nausea.
47370,The patient knows the foods that give  him this type of reaction such as tomato based sauces and tries to  avoid them as much as possible.
47371,The patient is asking me about Prilosec  which he recently read in the Journal and was wandering whether this  would be a suitable alternative to H blockers Patient had been on H  blockers for many years without a trial off of them which a reason that
47372,we stopped his H blocker therapy recently.
47373,With regard to the patients symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy  the patient says that these have almost completely resolved on the  mg  of Hytrin and which he will continue taking.
47374,The patient does remain on  Zestril for his hypertension as well as the Hytrin and the blood  pressure gotten by the nurse today was  and repeated by me   minutes later was .

47385,His blood pressure       appears to be well controlled on this regimen.
47386,One of the issues       would be whether or not the patient should be on a betablocker.
47387,The patient verbally has a history of a silent heart attack  and       there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an       option we will consider in the future although I would not add a       third antihypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his       Zestril with a betablocker. .
47388,GERD.

47394,The patient does have a known hiatal hernia which       may also contribute to his symptoms of chronic reflux. .
47395,BPH
47396,The patient will stay on his  mg of Hytrin which appears to       be working quite well.
47397,The patient notes that there is less       dribbling less nocturnal urination.
47398,The patient does take Lasix        mg once a day for congestive heart failure and did not have any       difficulty with urination after he takes the diuretic.

47400,Insomnia.
47401,The patient will stay on his Ambien

47403,The patient was formerly on Amitriptyline
47404,but       was told that the secondary side effects which can include EKG       changes and at this point tells me that the Ambien works and he       would like to stay on this.
47405,Patient has enough to last until I see       him next time.
47406,I will thus see the patient in  months for a fasting lipid The  patients lipid profile thus far has been acceptable.

47413,He is having a little bit of incontinence but Dr. Nixon  thinks that this should get better.
47414,We will have to recheck his platelets which have been in the  to   range.
47415,We also will look back at his echocardiogram which is showing  that he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly  dilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.
47416,He has remained on digoxin status  post his myocardial infarction.
47417,We want to recheck his cholesterol today.
47418,We also have been concerned  that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned  about his wifes situation with breast cancer.

47461,I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today.
47462,This lovely year old man has had past medical history notable for coronary artery disease hypertension benign prostatic hypertrophy depression insomnia osteoarthritis status post total knee replacement.
47463,He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic coronary artery disease.
47464,His history of coronary artery disease begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement in June of .
47465,In  he had an episode of profound weakness and sat down.
47466,He had no clear substernal chest pressure loss of consciousness or edema.
47467,Workup at that time included a thallium test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of .
47468,He began therapy at that point in time with aspirin niacin vitamin E Lasix Zestril Zantac Minipress Amitriptyline and Digoxin.
47469,He had been free of exertional neck chest arm and jaw pain paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea orthopnea palpitations claudication and TIA until this past spring.
47470,He actually had done very well with risk factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his weight.
47471,In March of  he began noticing that when he was going up the  steps in his house he began having midsternal chest discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs.
47472,He stopped working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on nitrate therapy.
47473,Since that time he has noted that he has had significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty.
47474,He does note fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only  to  hours a night.
47475,He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea orthopnea palpitations or lightheadedness.
47476,Medical regimen includes Ambien Paxil Isordil
47477,t.i.d.
47478,Atenolol Digoxin Zantac and aspirin.
47479,He has no known drug allergies.

47483,Page Two   heart rate of  and a respiratory rate of .
47484,There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.
47485,His carotids are free of bruits.
47486,His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout and cardiac exam is notable for a nondisplaced PMI S and physiologicallysplit S with no murmur rub or gallop.
47487,Abdominal exam is notable for a ventral hernia.
47488,There is no organomegaly and neither are there bruits present.
47489,Lower extremities are notable for  femoral popliteal dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses with no edema.
47490,Skin exam is notable only for the senile angioma.
47491,Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which is new since prior tracing available here of .
47492,MIBI was notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no significant ischemia on .
47493,The ejection fraction on a gated spect was .
47494,In summary it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in March of .
47495,He could however also have developed his progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block.
47496,I will be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision.
47497,In either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood pressure.
47498,I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would increase to
47499,mg p.o.
47500,q.d.
47501,I also would consider further decrease of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after assessing his response to reinitiation his nutrition program.
47502,Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily activity I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route.
47503,I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of risk factor reduction.
47504,I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you.
47505,Its certainly a pleasure to participate in his care.

47511,HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT
47512,This is a yearold gentleman   who had a stuttering course of chest discomfort throughout the   night last night and into today.
47513,He finally took nitroglycerin   tablets at about  or  a.m.
47514,and this abated his chest   discomfort.
47515,The patient has known history of coronary artery   disease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program   however yesterday after a workout he became extremely tired more   tire than usual.
47516,He thought he might have pushed it a bit and he   rested throughout the rest of the day.
47517,Then last night he had   some chest discomfort which he initially did not think much of.
47518,Then was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early   morning hours.
47519,He felt he was wheezing.
47520,This resolved after he   got up and walked around.
47521,He took the nitroglycerin tablets this   morning.
47522,These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just   obtained and this in fact resolved his symptoms.
47523,He then came in   to see Dr. Echeverria his physician in clinic and was sent to the   emergency department for evaluation.
47524,Please see the handwritten   emergency department record for additional details.

47530,His blood pressure is .
47531,His heart rate is in   the s.
47532,There is no evidence of congestive heart failure on   examination.
47533,There is no jugular venous distention and his lungs   are clear to auscultation.
47534,His heart examination is distant with   no murmurs or gallops appreciated.
47535,His extremities have trace   edema.
47536,Abdomen in soft and nontender.
47537,Pulses are equal.
47538,LABORATORY EVALUATION
47539,His electrocardiogram shows a left bundle   branch pattern with no change in configuration from previous   tracings.
47540,His other laboratory studies are pending.
47541,THERAPY RENDEREDCOURSE
47542,IN ED
47543,The case was discussed with his   physician Dr. Echeverria.
47544,We both agree that the patient has   probably had a progression of his coronary syndrome with possible   unstable plaque given his episode of shortness of breath and   paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
47545,It is possible that he has silent   ischemia which is not evident because of the left bundle branch   pattern.
47546,Pending the other evaluation and studies which are being   sent at this time the patient will require hospitalization for   further medical management.
47547,FINAL DIAGNOSIS
47548,Acute coronary insufficiency coronary artery   disease.

48105,Xochilt Vuong  MRN        REASON FOR VISIT
48106,Xochilt Vuong is a yearold patient of Dr. Wanda Yeomans and is sent because of rising serum creatinine.
48107,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
48108,Ms. Vuong has a history of diabetes mellitus   going back more than  years.
48109,She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids   over approximately the same period of time.
48110,She has a complicated history   including lung cancer and colon cancer both treated and in remission.
48111,Her   creatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of . in    . in May  .
48112,and .
48113,in early  with . in May  and recently .
48114,obtained on July  .
48115,She has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of ..
48116,Her serum folate B and iron and are not particularly low and MCV is normal   at .
48117,Urinalysis showed  albumin in September  and persisting   proteinuria since that time.
48118,Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in   March which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices but no evidence of   obstruction stones or masses.
48119,She has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration.
48120,She does   not know whether signs of diabetes are present but she has had no laser treatment   for any proliferative retinopathy.
48121,Recently she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and   almost constant nausea.
48122,She vomits rarely.
48123,Her weight has fallen by about    pounds.
48124,She is slightly constipated.
48125,She is moderately dyspneic on exertion.
48126,She   is not troubled by muscle cramps or by unusual itching of her skin.
48127,Her medications continue as listed with ACE inhibitors statins and a rather   large dose of Lasix at

48163,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
48164,On examination today she looks tired but   reasonably comfortable.
48165,She speaks in a highpitched somewhat hoarse voice   which has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.
48166,Her blood pressure in   the right arm sitting is  with regular pulse .
48167,Her chest has a few basal   crackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.
48168,JVP fills below the   sternal angle heart shows a grade  systolic murmur loudest at the upper left   sternal border.
48169,Abdomen is soft and nontender.
48170,There is no renal tenderness.
48171,Extremities have no edema.
48172,IMPRESSION
48173,Progressive renal failure in a yearold woman with more than    years history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
48174,The   proteinuria if confirmed would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but   this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.
48175,It would be useful to know   from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.
48176,It is of course also   possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.
48177,Their symmetry and   the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.
48178,The ACE   inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum   creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.
48179,Her loss of appetite and   nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.
48180,RECOMMENDATION
48181,I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia RD a renal   dietitian to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and   hyperlipidemia.
48182,This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.
48183,It think it   would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and   perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with   less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.
48184,If of course shortness of   breath worsens or edema appears then returning to the Lasix would be   reasonable.
48185,It might be that a longer acting milder diuretic such as  mg of   metolazone might help to control edema and potassium and reduce the   requirement for Lasix.
48186,If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and   diuresis it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural and it might   be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.
48187,Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit   from instituting therapy with Epogen such as  units twice a week or   Aranesp.
48188,PLAN
48189,We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio which may   help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.
48190,If so the   measures proposed would be appropriate.
48191,We discussed the eventual probable   need for dialysis assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes.
48192,It would   be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department located here on our   floor at G along with Ms. Xias office to learn about modes of dialysis.
48193,We discussed construction of a forearm fistula which should be done well before   a need for it arises.
48194,I would in fact recommend that she proceed to have this   done in the next few months.
48195,This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysanas office   or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.
48196,I will of course help with any of   these measures as necessary.
48197,Xander Xie M.D.
48198,Wanda
48199,Urine total proteincreatinine ratio is only .
48200,corresponding to about . gday or proteinuria.
48201,This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy and argues in favor of vascular disease.
48202,I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.
48203,If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

48632,In the ER he was started on IVFs and labs were sent.
48633,Impression      Mr. Wood is a  yo M w Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with  day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.
48634,His Hct stabilized at  since his transfer from his PCPs office.
48635,His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.
48636,He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.
48637,Given that he hasnt had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.
48638,Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response but his DTR were normal.
48639,Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.
48640,He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.
48641,His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.
48642,He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.
48643,Given his chest pain and syncope MI will be ruled out but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.
48644,His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.

49049,Mr Albert has progressive renal insufficiency he does currently not require renal replacement therapy.
49050,Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration.
49051,However the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCVassociated renal disease a worthy consideration.
49052,Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.
49053,I took the liberty to order a hour urine collection a kidney US as well as SPEP UPEP
49054,cryoglobulin level Festudies.
49055,Norvasc mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment.
49056,For now I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.
49057,Bobbie will have a blood pressure check in  weeks when he is in Nappanee for another appointment and I will see him in four weeks.
49058,At that point he will be evaluated for EpogenAranesp.

49815,Dear Dr. Ho
49816,I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Lindsay today in follow up at the Saint Davids Pavilion Neurology.
49817,I last saw her on .
49818,She is a yearold woman who is status post a right MCA distribution cortical infarct in April of  with residual left hand weakness.
49819,Since I last saw her Mrs. Lindsay has not done very well.
49820,She has had multiple recent falls and her gait has become even more unsteady.
49821,She tends to veer to either side and does have a frequent feeling of lightheadedness.
49822,She has hit her head on a couple of occasions with these falls.
49823,Of note her blood pressure medication has been essentially doubled since I last saw her.
49824,She is now taking  mg of Zestril every day instead of five and taking Atenolol  mg q.d. instead of
49825,mg p.o.
49826,q.d.
49827,She does have intermittent weakness of the left hand which is likely recrudescent of her prior stroke symptoms and not new strokes.
49828,She does not have discoordination vertigo or diplopia.
49829,She does have intermittent chest pains as well which she loath to bring to the attention of her physician.
49830,She is reluctant to use a cane because her family states that her husband does not use a cane and he is older why should she have to use a cane.
49831,She has been switched to Plavix  mg p.o.
49832,q.d. from aspirin.
49833,This was done without my knowledge as well.
49834,She continues to have difficulty feeling my feet and this has been a chronic problem for her as well.
49835,On examination she is alert.
49836,She is a garrulous and tangential historian and needs to be frequently refocussed.
49837,Her speech is fluent in English.
49838,English is her second language and she is less fluent in that language.
49839,Her visual fields are full to confrontation.
49840,Her extraocular movements are full with no nystagmus.
49841,Her face is symmetric other than a mild left nasolabial fold flattening.
49842,She has a mild left pronator drift and slowed finger tapping on the left side.
49843,She has no ataxia on fingertonosetofinger testing.
49844,Her gait is slightly widebased and unsteady.
49845,She can veer to either side and frequently has to hold on to someone next to her for stability.
49846,IMPRESSION I do not feel that Mrs. Lindsay has had a new embolic event however I am quite concerned about her continued falling and difficulty with both her continued peripheral neuropathy and likely hypoperfusion.
49847,This appears to be pressure dependent and I would suggest that we back off on her antihypertensive medications at this time.
49848,In looking at her recent CBCs she has also been consistently anemic and with her complaints of chronic fatigue I think this could certainly be a factor.
49849,Atenolol could certainly be a factor in this as well and perhaps a different antihypertensive medication could be considered or it could be discontinued altogether.
49850,Furthermore with her recurrent chest pains she should seek an opinion from her primary care physician regarding this and I have counseled her to do so.
49851,I will see Mrs. Lindsay in follow up in  months time
49852,but I am available to discuss her care at any time in the interim.
49853,Sincerely      Hudsen Parsons

50015,AP   yo F with pmh of DM CRI Breast Ca CVA who is sp cataract surgery on  presents with two days of unsteady gait weakness mild dysarthria and hallucinations.
50016,She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor to her medications.
50017,This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia.
50018,Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances infections drug toxicity metabolic disorders low perfusion states withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives and idiopathic.
50019,In addition there is the possibility of CVA however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA.
50020,Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.
50021,Metabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na Ca Mg B NH imbalances.
50022,Her Na Mg and Ca are wnl.
50023,Her BUN is elevated at  which is close to twice her baseline and in the setting of a fragile patient this could be enough to tip her over to delirium.
50024,Her glucose was  on admission which is elevated but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur.
50025,Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at .
50026,with  polys.
50027,However there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and UA likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively.
50028,She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery.
50029,She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure but without a fever this is highly unlikely.
50030,Her mental status change could be drug induced as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family.
50031,Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS.
50032,However cardiovascular drugs antidepressants and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them including two SSRIs.
50033,The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion and by inducing more diuresis it can cause a prerenal state thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels thus leading to delirium.
50034,Indeed her baseline Creatinine is from .. and was .
50035,on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from  while it was  on admission to the ED.
50036,There is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative.
50037,There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a postictal state
50038,Her BP on admission was
50039,and her pulse was  which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause.
50040,She had a recent stress test that was negative.
50041,However it is possible that she has some orthostasis which would fit with her recent history of falls at home.
50042,However this would not cause the delirium.
50043,Her dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimers vascular dementia pseudodementia thyroid abnormalities B andor Folate deficiency tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia.
50044,Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions.

50465,yo African American male with recent complicated hospital stay at BMH presents to hematology clinic for first time for follow up of his thrombocytosis.
50466,This  yo male with history of type I DM who does not get regular medical care in late August was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity.
50467,At the time blood sugar was .
50468,Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland he has BP  plt count was in s.
50469,The patient was intubated treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.
50470,At BMH MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA echo was done showing no vegetations no PFO NL EF with LVH TEE without vegetations as well.
50471,LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.
50472,He underent a renal workup which showed  nephrotic range proteinuria labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis.
50473,Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.
50474,He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.
50475,Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo pheo.
50476,The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the th.
50477,HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.
50478,He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.
50479,Hematologically the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.
50480,Plt count stayed stable in the s for several days before increasing on the rd gradually up to the s.   Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were cw ACD and he was started on epogen.
50481,Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive CRP was  with ESR .
50482,He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
50483,But his platelets kept climbing to nearly . million.
50484,A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.
50485,As well he suffered a DVT in his subclavianIJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.
50486,Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.
50487,As well hydrea was started at this time initially at mg bid and then escalated to mg bid when his counts were up to  despite the medication.
50488,As well he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.
50489,For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.
50490,He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then.
50491,His energy has been good.

50531,million and had subsequent provoked DVT.
50532,He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.
50533,Today he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea.
50534,It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.
50535,At the moment we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin
50536,mg qd.
50537,If this is a reactive process time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospitalicu stay.
50538,At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his Creactive protein ESR iron studiesferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis.
50539,If his plt count comes down we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.
50540,Of note in the near future we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK kinase level.
50541,In the meantime he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.

50644,Assessment and Plan Mr. Goins is a  yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency subsequently found to have nephrotic syndrome renal insufficiency and several small embolicappearing strokes.
50645,In this setting he has developed marked thrombocytosis to .
50646,million and had subsequent provoked DVT.
50647,He was treated with platelet pheresis then hydrea.
50648,It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis.
50649,We are following his CBC on hydrea.
50650,His platelets are moderately elevated
50651,K.
50652,He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis.
50653,His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia.
50654,We would advise starting erythropoetin monitoring his blood pressure closely.
50655,At his current platelet count his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia.
50656,We would advise continuing current hydrea.
50657,Continue current hydrea Monitor counts monthly Agree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine.
50658,Return in  months for followup of counts

51705,HeadNeck      Diffuse atherosclerotic disease occluded RICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries.
51706,IMPRESSION The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN DM and HLP.
51707,His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation.
51708,His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke.
51709,The patient was reportedly taking aspirin though reports are mixed and this needs clarification.
51710,Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebrobasilar thromboembolism but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis.
51711,Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebrobasilar disease but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some hrs after initial symptoms and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely.
51712,Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebrobasilar disease because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported.
51713,The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN DM and HLP.
51714,The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary.

51954,IDDM large cell lymphoma in  and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology.
51955,The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and noninfectious diagnoses.
51956,Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease such as COP.
51957,However we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered.
51958,Endemic mycoses histo blasto and crypto cryptococcal pneumonia nocardiasis aspergillus mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient.
51959,While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis.
51960,I AYX have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note.
51961,My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOPCOP.
51962,An occult infection is quite possible such as pulmonary MAC or a mold the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious.
51963,Clinically he is unchanged over many months so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated.
51964,We recommend the following workup  Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture Induced sputum for PCP Modified AFB smear looking for Nocardia Fungal stain and culture Urine histo antigen
51965,Serum cryptococcal antigen Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and Dglucan Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel RSV Adenovirus Influenza A and B paraflu A and B and viral culture
51966,If the above workup is unrevealing please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy  sooner rather than later.
51967,It is reasonable to start is levaquin

52402,No motor or  sensory deficits.
52403,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE
52404,Initial EKG showed a rate of about   unclear.
52405,It seemed that there was T waves in V.
52406,There is  no evidence of ST elevation MI.
52407,We thought this could be an SVT.
52408,It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation.
52409,Our  plan was to give adenosine however during the IV placement.
52410,Prior to giving adenosine the patient converted to a normal  sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around
52411,but it was  clear that there was T waves.
52412,At this point we decided to give  her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.
52413,LABORATORY DATA
52414,Labs checked include sodium of  potassium  .

52425,UA is negative for  infection with trace blood present.
52426,PLAN
52427,Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient  had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.
52428,If both of  those enzymes are negative we feel that she is safe to go home  from the ED Observation Unit.
52429,It is unclear the etiology of her  arrhythmia.
52430,It did seem to be likely SVT which broke  spontaneously.
52431,The patient is to follow up with her primary  doctor.

52446,Hospital course cb GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum sp exlap  gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection splenectomy and primary anastamosis with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.
52447,He also had VREklebsiella LUQ abscess sp IR drainage.
52448,He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.
52449,So he was switched to vancoambisomelinezolidmeropenemamikacin for LUQ abscess.
52450,After  weeks of highdose ambisome he was taken back to OR on  for reexploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophagealjejunostomy site that surgeons scooped out as much as they could but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions.
52451,Given the inability to completely enbloc resect Mr. Ethridges GI mucor despite a longtrial of Ambisome he was started on an investigational drug posaconazole provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.
52452,This has had  success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.
52453,He was started on this drug on  and has tolerated it well despite some nausea diarrhea.
52454,He has been at EDUCAREFARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.
52455,He walks with a walker.

52481,Will need EKG again at EDUCAREFARGO before transfer here.
52482,Mr. Ethridge seen and examined with Dr. Roberts.
52483,He is very slowly improving in terms of strength no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN.
52484,Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects.
52485,On balance if his labs are ok Id favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings.

52496,The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse.
52497,Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill.
52498,The patient then presented to the EDUCAREPULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment.
52499,In the ER the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit.
52500,The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment.
52501,Of note the patient denies any pain   numbness  coolness in his hand.
52502,He further denies any shortness of breath increased swelling in his legs or changes in his weight.

52925,This is a regularly scheduled visit for this Eva Ruledge a  year old woman with a history of hypertension and borderline obesity.
52926,She was last here in February with no complaints but did have an elevated  creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further  evaluation.
52927,The patient did not however present to the Internal Medicine as  planned.
52928,She states that she has been too busy.
52929,Her only complaint  today is of some right leg pain which she says is chronic and which is  relieved to some extent by acetaminophen.
52930,Eva continues to take Procardia XL
52931,mg.
52932,PO q.day.
52933,A noted in her  ambulatory record the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d.
52934,drug however
52935,Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than  on an almost p.r.n.
52936,basis.
52937,Review of systems is essentially normal.
52938,Specifically she denies any  headaches any chest pain any shortness of breath.
52939,She also denies any  symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.
52940,She has no history of  dysuria of frequent urinary tract infection or of hematuria.
52941,Physical Examination
52942,She is robust appearing.
52943,Vital signs are  significant for a blood pressure of .
52944,HEENT exam is unremarkable.
52945,Lungs are clear.
52946,Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm a normal  S S.
52947,No S is appreciated.
52948,There are no murmurs or rubs.
52949,Abdomen is  slightly obese nontender and with normal bowel sounds.
52950,No masses are  appreciated.
52951,Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not  suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.
52952,Indeed exam of  her legs is entirely unremarkable.
52953,Laboratory  Will include a repeat creatinine a urinalysis and urine  sediment and a urine creatinine.
52954,Assessment and Plan   .
52955,Hypertension
52956,Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure       on her Procardia.
52957,I have asked her to stop taking Procardia which       she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol       beginning at  mg.
52958,PO q.day.
52959,I will see her in a few days in order       to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug       and also to check her blood pressure once again.
52960,.
52961,Right leg pain
52962,This would appear to be chronic and may well be       related to her work which requires her to scuttle throughout the       hospital at fairly high speed She is a Pulping Control Operator.
52963,I  have asked her to continue taking       Tylenol and we will reevaluate her need for more powerful agents       such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.

52966,Elevated creatinine
52967,Unfortunately Eva has not kept her Renal       appointment.
52968,In order to prevent this from recurring a third time I       have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.
52969,She is to see him on the th of this month at  p.m.
52970,and I have       also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.
52971,Hopefully he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this       elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney       function.
52972,.
52973,Health Maintenance
52974,The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear       today but again was too busy to stay that long.
52975,She is to see me       again shortly and a Pap smear will be done at that time.
52976,Her       February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and       will not be repeated until next year.

53577,This was treated with Metformin.
53578,Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added apparently for hypertension although the patient does not believe he has been diagnosed with hypertension.
53579,He subsequently developed diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was subsequently reduced in dose.
53580,In June of the past year the patient was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his Hydrochlorothiazide.
53581,At that time he also was found to have lower extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the Hydrochlorothiazide.
53582,The patient states in September of  he traveled to trinidad and tobago.
53583,While in trinidad and tobago he had a marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he found it difficult to ambulate.
53584,He denied any difficulty with chest pains or shortness of breath.
53585,He had no hemoptysis and no focal unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility during the trip.
53586,He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema significantly.
53587,However he subsequently developed diarrhea to this medication and it was stopped.
53588,Subsequently his lower extremity has once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn.
53589,At the present time Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath.

53642,The thyroid gland is normal.
53643,Jugular venous distention to approximately  cm. was noted.
53644,Neck was supple.
53645,Examination of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness at both bases.
53646,There was no egophony and no wheezes.
53647,Otherwise the lungs were clear.
53648,Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm normal S and S an intermittent S was appreciated.
53649,No RV heave or lift was appreciated.
53650,No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.
53651,The pontic component of S was moderately enhanced.
53652,No appreciable murmurs were detected.
53653,The point of maximum impulse was in the anterior axillary line.
53654,Examination of the abdomen revealed a nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge three fingerbreadths below the right costal margin.
53655,This was nontender and smooth.
53656,Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well.

53660,There were no skin changes consistent with collagen vascular disease.
53661,Multiple follicular lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as well as on the left arm.
53662,Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal.

53671,The right ventricle was mildly dilated and hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function.
53672,There was trace MR with moderate TR.
53673,A peak systolic artery pressure of  plus right atrial pressure was noted.
53674,In summary Dr. Rodriquez is a yearold gentleman with a clear cut pulmonary hypertension.
53675,The etiology of this is not clear at the moment.
53676,Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic disease occult underlying pulmonary disease doubt obstructive sleep apnea and collagen vascular disease.
53677,In addition some patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of exclusion.
53678,The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree with increasing his diuretic regimen.
53679,Im embarking on a course of evaluation to exclude the most likely causes.
53680,In specific he will be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic disease this afternoon.
53681,This has already been arranged by Dr. Faust.
53682,In addition Im sending serology including an ANA an antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL.
53683,Ive also asked Dr. Rodriquez Page
53684,Freeman Faust M.D.
53685,RE Jacob Rodriquez M.D.
53686,January     to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea.
53687,He will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an arterial blood gas drawn.
53688,If this evaluation should be unrevealing he may require more invasive diagnostics.
53689,Ive already consulted formally with Dr. Eddie Roy the physician with most experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our workup is nondiagnostic.
53690,Dr. Faust thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.
53691,Ill plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after his diagnostic tests have been performed.
53692,Please do not hesitate to call me with any further questions or concerns.

54922,Had been on Atenolol and Zestril but pt selfDCd Zestril several wks ago because she thought the Zestril made her feel nauseated.
54923,Since then has had gradually developing DOE   from baseline of walking over  flights of stairs without difficulty to dyspnea on only a flight of stairs.
54924,She underwent L knee arthroscopy for medial meniscal tear on  without immediate complications.

55615,She was noted to be persistently anemic with a   Hematocrit of . on .
55616,It was felt that her low hematocrit was due to both blood loss from
55617,Persistent severe menorrhagia as well as a dilutional component from fluid overload.

55820,Very high pulm pressures with dilated pulmonary arteries especially in comparison to prior echos in the setting of sudden onset SOB and LE edema in a patient who is sedentary and has had thrombotic events in the past makes PE a likely possibility.
55821,Her poorly controlled HTN LE edema and rales  make flash pulmonary edema another consideration.
55822,Despite her lack of a significant smoking history she had emphasematous changes on prior chest CT scans  and so could be at risk for a COPD exacerbation but she had good air movement wo wheezes.
55823,Her face appears slightly swollen and she has had SVC syndrome in the past but her facial swelling is likely related to her steroids she has only mild venous distention on her chest and she claims her fascial swelling is not worse then usual.
55824,Agree w lasix
55825,mg iv BID but pt may be preload dependent w such severe pulm htn so we have to avoid volume depleting her VQ scan and LE dopplers
55826,If no PE and not better w lasix then will need to consider chest CT w IV contrast to ro SVC syndrome and parechymal lund problems.
55827,When pt feeling better I would check full PFTS to evaluate pulm htn and possibility of COPD.
55828,I would also screen her for alphaantitrypsin deficiency given the emphysematous changes on prior CT.

56438,The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.
56439,He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.
56440,However the episodicity is significant. .
56441,Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output and is cold and wet pattern.
56442,His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.
56443,However the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected.
56444,It is also possible that this is related to angina. .
56445,Other related risks.
56446,He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.
56447,It is possible that he has had other emboli possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.
56448,There are no obvious contraindications to transplant.
56449,At this time we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation.
56450,Our plan is to hold his betablockers and ACE inhibitors for now and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion.
56451,We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.

58028,Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue which is worse today than yesterday.
58029,Differential includes CHF with fluid overload PE malignancy with obstructive component PNA or COPD exacerbation with viral infection.

58032,BNP is not very high.
58033,However patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.

58397,Dear Dr. Colon
58398,I am writing to inform you that I am seeing Mr. Oliver Jain in followup.
58399,Mr. Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm as you know.
58400,He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October.
58401,During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed.
58402,He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm.
58403,He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery.
58404,Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot.
58405,In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well.
58406,The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first second and third toes.
58407,He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through.
58408,He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot.
58409,He has no evidence of fevers chills rigors or shakes in the interim.
58410,He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe.
58411,His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity.
58412,He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports.
58413,On exam today he is doing quite well.
58414,He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital.
58415,His head and neck exams were unremarkable.
58416,His lungs were clear.
58417,Heart was regular.
58418,His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound.
58419,With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration.
58420,There is no evidence of cellulitis induration or infection of the right lower extremity.
58421,He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left.
58422,Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle.
58423,He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level.
58424,This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot.
58425,His left calf ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar.
58426,In summary this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity.
58427,He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity.
58428,Given this concern I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limbthreatening gangrene of the left.
58429,With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably reevaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter.
58430,I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes.
58431,My thanks again for this referral.
58432,I apologize for not sending you correspondence earlier.
58433,With this correspondence I will send you his operative diagram as well as his most recent discharge summary.
58434,Sincerely

58715,Impression
58716,Mrs. Haynes is a pleasant  yo female with biopsy demonstrating noncaesating granululoma in a left eye nodule and mediastinal lymph nodes.
58717,Cx data was not obtained.
58718,However hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors.
58719,Clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis.
58720,At this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids.
58721,At this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and Dr. Villalpando.
58722,Recommendations     Would consider Cardiac MRI given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment.
58723,Would recommend checking PPD Would recommend starting prednisone mg po qday.
58724,Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow.
58725,There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr. Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs. Haynes.
58726,Would also recommend Bactrim prophylaxis while she is on greater than  mg Po prednisone.
58727,DS MWF.
58728,Will follow.
58729,Thank you for this interesting consult.

58735,Re  Dalila Haynes
58736,Dear Dr. Kay    I saw Dalila Haynes today in consultation concerning the possibility of neurosarcoidosis.
58737,She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.
58738,I will review her history for the record.
58739,She is a yearold righthanded woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July  for evaluation of mental and motor slowing memory loss and weight loss.
58740,Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.
58741,Her movements slowed down and she became unsteady on her feet and her memory deteriorated.
58742,This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.
58743,During that hospitalization a head CT on  was reported unremarkable.
58744,There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.
58745,An MRI of the brain on  showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
58746,There was no abnormal enhancement.
58747,This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
58748,EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
58749,An LP showed normal glucose  elevated protein  lymphocytic pleocytosis  WBC  lymphocytes  monocytes and  neutrophils and  RBC.
58750,CSF ACE was normal.
58751,Cultures were negative.
58752,CSF VDRL was negative.
58753,Because she has a history of sarcoidosis it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.
58754,She was started on prednisone
58755,mg daily.
58756,Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone but she remains abnormal.
58757,She has lowered the prednisone to
58758,mg daily now.
58759,Reviewing the laboratory studies today I see that although an RPR was nonreactive a TAIgG was positive and the confirming treponemal tests FTA was also positive at the state lab.
58760,She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.
58761,Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na  and Mg .
58762,normal vitamin B folate TSH and ESR .
58763,CSF HSV PCR was negative.
58764,HbAC was elevated at ..
58765,She has a history of asthma going back many years.
58766,According to her daughter she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.
58767,Apparently this showed noncaseated granuloma and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.
58768,She then had a mediatinoscopy on .
58769,Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
58770,She has type II DM HTN hypercholesterolemia GERD and she has had a thyroid adenoma.
58771,Her current medications are prednisone
58772,mg daily aspirin
58773,mg daily troglitazone metformin glyburide sisinoril pravastatin vitamin D calcium CO Colace and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.
58774,She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.
58775,There is no history of allergy to PCN.
58776,Her parents both died of some type of cancer.
58777,There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.
58778,She is a widow.
58779,She has four children.
58780,She used to work for Lowes.
58781,She now lives with a daughter.
58782,She has had no recent fever or chills.
58783,Her weight has been stable and her appetite good.
58784,There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations.
58785,There is no history of cough dyspnea nausea vomiting or diarrhea.
58786,She has had no rash or joint symptoms.

58790,She is obese.
58791,Ears nose and throat are clear.
58792,There are no cranial bruits.
58793,The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.
58794,There are wheezes bilaterally.
58795,The heart is regular with no murmur.
58796,The abdomen is benign.
58797,The extremities are normal.
58798,There is general psychomotor slowing.
58799,She is oriented to time expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug .
58800,She is oriented to place.
58801,She is inattentive.
58802,She is able to recite the months in order but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.
58803,She has trouble registering  words and she recalls only  of  after three minutes.
58804,There is no aphasia.
58805,She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a D cube shows poor spacial representation.
58806,The visual fields are full.
58807,The pupils are
58808,mm and normally reactive.
58809,The fundi are poorly visualized.
58810,.
58811,The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus pursuit movement are saccadic.
58812,Facial sensation is intact.
58813,Facial power is normal and symmetric.
58814,Hearing is grossly intact.
58815,Weber and Rinne tests are normal.
58816,The palate elevates normal.
58817,Gag is present.
58818,The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal.
58819,The tongue protrudes in the midline.
58820,Muscle bulk tone and power are normal.
58821,There is a lowamplitude highfrequency tremor in action and rest.
58822,Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distallypredominant gradient.
58823,Reflexes are normal  and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.
58824,Plantar responses are flexor.
58825,Coordination is intact.
58826,Romberg is negative.
58827,Gait and station are normal.
58828,Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.
58829,Since syphilis too could cause noncaseating granulomas and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
58830,I will review that issue with you and with Dr Villalpando.
58831,She had CSF pleocytosis in July.
58832,With that and the positive treponemal test FTA she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.
58833,I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.
58834,Concerning her need for prednisone I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.
58835,If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course her CSF and her syphilis serologies.
58836,Finally from the MRI of  shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
58837,These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.
58838,She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke
58839,but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.
58840,I would recommend treatment now with a day course of highdose  million units a day penicillin.
58841,She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible JarischHerxheimer reaction.
58842,I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone to follow her clinically and with repeated LP and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.
58843,Thank you for this consultation.

58851,Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July .
58852,She was hospitalized at Promptcare in July  for evaluation of mental and motor slowing memory loss and weight loss that had progressed over  to  months.
58853,Head CT on  with only mild ventriculomegaly.
58854,An MRI of the brain on  showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
58855,There was no abnormal enhancement.

58977,systemic sarcoidosis extensive adenopathy in the chest abdomen and adrenal glands and has been on corticosteroids CNS syphillis sp treatment  who presents with several weeks of increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion.
58978,Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events.
58979,Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities.
58980,Head CT unremarkable.
58981,Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid.
58982,She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms she should have repeat LP.
58983,She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology.
58984,This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor POs but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion.
58985,CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA but with normal WBC no URI sxs or cough and no fever I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically.
58986,check her gait check ESR    LP for standard studies and save  cc for additional studies depending on cell countTP MRI of the brain EEG further lab wu pending LP results remove foley catheter PT consult       Bobby S. Galvan M.D.

59035,Diabetes.
59036,Her Ac today was . which represents excellent control despite a fairly high glucoses she was recording.
59037,I therefore did not want to increase her regimen despite the high glucoses.
59038,We will continue for now.

59047,She is asymptomatic in this regard except for some fatigue.
59048,.
59049,Fatigue.
59050,This is most likely due to stepping down from the prednisone .
59051,This is what the patient and her daughter believe.
59052,She was somewhat fatigued before but they note that it is worse with this.
59053,She does need to come off the prednisone and Dr. Villalpando who she just saw is going to try to come up with another plan for her.

59156,Big Bear Lake CO    To Dr. Estep
59157,I saw Betty Gillis in cardiovascular clinic with Dr. Vicente Noel on .
59158,Betty Gillis is a very pleasant yearold woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February  with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness.
59159,Fortunately her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities.
59160,We understand that she has also had previous strokes.
59161,In December  she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct.
59162,She recalls having only V clinical events.
59163,She was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only an echocardiogram which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than .
59164,She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.
59165,This lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise.
59166,There is no history of atrial fibrillation coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.

59170,She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath.
59171,Moreover she does not have claudication.
59172,Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema.

59219,Family History
59220,Betty Gillis is adopted and does not know very much about her biological parents.
59221,She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point but cannot say for certain how old he was.
59222,Social History
59223,This woman is single.
59224,She is a retired Secretary.
59225,She is an exsmoker more than  pack years but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol.
59226,She has no other history of substance abuse.
59227,Review of Systems
59228,Functional inquiry is positive for difficulties with psoriasis that are chronic and ongoing.
59229,She has no other new symptoms.
59230,There is no recent GI bleeding.
59231,She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well.
59232,On physical examination today her heart rate is  beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is  in the right arm and  in the left arm.
59233,Respiratory rate is
59234,and she is pink on room air.
59235,Head and neck exam is unremarkable.
59236,There are no carotid bruits.
59237,She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine.
59238,Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only.
59239,Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated.
59240,Central pulses are normal in volume and contour.
59241,Her apex beat is within normal limits.
59242,Heart sounds include a normal S and S with no murmurs.
59243,Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
59244,There are no obvious masses.
59245,Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged.
59246,Her pulses are palpable in her groin but hard to feel behind her knees and distally.
59247,They are symmetrical.
59248,Informally ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated.
59249,A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.
59250,Impression
59251,Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging.
59252,We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive.
59253,It does not look particularly positive to our eyes.
59254,Certainly if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale there is no issue as to what to do about it.
59255,If she does have one however it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those.
59256,Her hypertension is controlled today.
59257,Her dyslipidemia is not bad.
59258,However the LDL is  and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to
59259,mg p.o.
59260,daily.
59261,We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past as high as  as well as an elevated hemoglobin Ac up to ..
59262,It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type  diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only.
59263,She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.
59264,We recommend. .
59265,We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale. .
59266,We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin  mg p.o.
59267,daily to simvastatin
59268,mg p.o.
59269,daily.
59270,We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize. .
59271,We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type .
59272,We will see her again as necessary but for the time being we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady.

59490,PLAN   yo woman with a history of stroke HTN who presents with L arm numbness.
59491,While her deficits appear to have resolved arguing against stroke she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke.
59492,These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCAPCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli.
59493,Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.
59494,Has had stroke workup in the past that has been unrevealing   Would benefit from a repeat echocardiogram to assess for any new vegetations or thrombi
59495,Would also benefit from repeat Holter to assess for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

60765,Discussion
60766,Sarcoidosis until proven otherwise.
60767,She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission.
60768,The lung findings systemic symptoms hypercalcemia anemia abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis.
60769,Her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion.
60770,She should not receive diuretics at present.
60771,Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment.
60772,I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia but we need definitive diagnosis first.
60773,The cardiac murmur is impressive but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease.
60774,We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function.
60775,The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point.
60776,Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding.
60777,Suggest  .
60778,Stop HCTZavoid diuretics until fully volume repleted. .
60779,IV normal saline.
60780,May need rates in the  range to control her hypercalcemia acutely
60781,but she has had this for some time so can be conservative with fluids approach. .
60782,Agree with check PTH vitamin D levels. .
60783,Follow lytes creatinine calcium Hct. .
60784,Agree with check echocardiogram. .
60785,We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation.
60786,Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

60977,She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on  and now presents with nausea vomiting and several days of poor PO intake.
60978,This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year  first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis.
60979,She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery.
60980,The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day.
60981,The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis.
60982,She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days.
60983,She denies fevers chills headaches cough abdominal pain or change in the character of her colostomy output.
60984,ED COURSE
60985,On arrival to the ED vitals were as follows     RA.
60986,Her abdomen was nontender and minimally distended.
60987,CT of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified.
60988,She was seen by surgery and an NGT was placed.
60989,She was given L of IVF and morphine mg IV x.
60990,ROS As above otherwise reports baseline blurry vision has been told of cataracts in the past.

61140,SBO Her clinical presentation and CT findings are concerning for small bowel obstruction although ileus remains a possibility.
61141,Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely.
61142,Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time.
61143,Appreciate surgery input NGT to low wall suction NPO except meds for bowel rest
61144,Serial abdominal exams Check colostomy output guaiac Acute renal failure Her creatinine was up from a baseline of .
61145,to . on admission.
61146,With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to .
61147,so it was likely prerenal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.
61148,Continue IVF while NPO Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF workup if not down on AM labs
61149,Anemia Baseline hematocrit in low s last .
61150,prior to discharge on .
61151,She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing.
61152,She likely either has irondeficiency anemia although she has been taking iron supplements or anemia of chronic disease  or a combination thereof.
61153,Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.
61154,Transfuse U PRBCs Check colostomy guaiac Check iron studies reticulocyte

61156,She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVTPE sp IVC filter placement.
61157,She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin.

61262,Failure to thrive  lethargy
61263,The etiology of this pts lethargy is unclear.
61264,It is notable however that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intraabdominal bacterial collection.
61265,At present there is no clear source of infection although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI.
61266,Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
61267,In addition to bacteremia UTI and reaccumulation of an intraabdominal collection other possible causes of her lethargy include toxicmetabolic causes such as uremia anemia or depression.
61268,Fu blood  urine and respiratory cultures                   Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis If we were to start abx would                    recommend vanccefepime given micro history

61271,Source of anemia has been unclear in the past.
61272,During last admission pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy.
61273,GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy.
61274,It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive.

61466,Friday he did see his PCP who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead and told him to return to the ED bc he still had a terrible HA so he came back to the EDUCAREPULLMAN ED tonight.

61468,However a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait.

61512,Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait which does appear a bit widebased but he and wife confirm that this is chronic and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems.
61513,Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA and his uncontrolled DM of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education.

61523,A note from Dr. Robert Irish neurosurgery from  notes that he is sp cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum.
61524,He is doing much better today.

61915,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
61916,This yearold ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.
61917,The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.
61918,In February she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.
61919,There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.
61920,This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion she fell getting out of bed.
61921,The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.
61922,She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected she feels that the event has not reoccured.
61923,The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.
61924,She was seen by Neurology on  after she was admitted.
61925,The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.
61926,Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.
61927,Also in the record is noted that at the time of the second event her glucose was very low at around  and symptoms resolved after treatment with D.
61928,There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.
61929,On examination at the time of admission there were no clear findings.
61930,MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.
61931,The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.
61932,MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about  cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.
61933,Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.
61934,Currently the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.
61935,It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.
61936,Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.
61937,Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.
61938,There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.
61939,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
61940,Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.
61941,The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.
61942,There are no medication allergies reported.
61943,PAST FAMILYSOCIAL HISTORY

61953,The patient is overweight.
61954,Height is  foot  inches.
61955,Weight is  pounds.
61956,Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants though without clear spasm.
61957,Poor neck posture is noted.
61958,Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.
61959,Cardiovascular testing carotids are  without bruits.
61960,Temporal arteries are normal.
61961,Musculoskeletal testing gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.
61962,Romberg is negative.
61963,Tandem gait is normal.
61964,The patient does move slowly in general this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.
61965,There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.
61966,This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.
61967,There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.
61968,NEUROLOGICAL TESTING
61969,Mental status is essentially normal to orientation memory attention language and fund of information.
61970,Cranial nerve testing pupils are
61971,mm and briskly reactive.
61972,Extraocular movements are full.
61973,Visual fields are intact.
61974,There is no facial sensory loss but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.

61982,There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.
61983,Coordination testing today seemed intact.
61984,Prior neurologic evaluation from  is reviewed.
61985,Homocystine level was elevated at  normal zero to ten.
61986,Recommended treatment included folate pyridoxine and B.  IMPRESSION
61987,Transient neurologic symptoms question etiology.
61988,Comment.
61989,I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.
61990,I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.
61991,Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.
61992,In this regard the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.
61993,It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.
61994,PLAN
61995,Although she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.
61996,She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.
61997,We therefore suggested Plavix
61998,mg daily.
61999,We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.
62000,It probably does not matter which medication she chooses however she should be on one or the other and not both.
62001,For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation we have added simply multivitamins two daily.
62002,I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.
62003,She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.
62004,We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

63268,Dizziness and change in mental status    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
63269,Mr. Ishida is a  yo who pw dizziness that began  to  weeks ago.
63270,The pt says the dizziness was worsened when he stood up to walk around noting that it was particularly bad when he was standing and concentrating on a particular task such as shaving.
63271,The dizziness was alleviated by him lying down.
63272,He added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated.
63273,He drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable then he stopped.
63274,He later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional Cocacola beverages.
63275,During these  weeks of dizziness Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost  days of his life saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious.
63276,He came to this conclusion bc his medication box was still full for the previous  days supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication.
63277,Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like lightheadness.
63278,He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol  weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms.
63279,Mr. Ishida says hes never experienced any dizziness before and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed.
63280,Mr. Ishida also described an increased pressure in his head saying it felt as if my eyes and ears were going to explode.

63418,Mr. Ishida is a  yo M with ho CKD HTN and NIDDM pw sustained dizziness and altered mental status.
63419,Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated.
63420,He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager  or  bottles of Cocacola over several days.
63421,This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea his diuretic medication and possible osmotic diuresis increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic could have shifted him into hypovolemia.
63422,Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUNCr ratio to be elevated indicating a prerenal process.
63423,Although BUNCr ratio is not gt we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and ho CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUNCr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure.
63424,Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs e.g. Naproxen an ARB and an ACEI all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.
63425,Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs e.g. amphotericin cisplatin or aminoglycosides.
63426,Conversely he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his ho of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.
63427,Lastly Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his ho BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.
63428,Mr. Ishidas dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF.
63429,Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication brain hemorrhagic brain tumor etc.
63430,PLAN
63431,Acture Renal Failure
63432,Continue fluids and hydration L of IV saline over the next  hrs
63433,Dc naproxen use.
63434,Rule out Postrenal etiology use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters.
63435,If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate.
63436,Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.
63437,DM
63438,Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.
63439,CAD        Switch Atenlol to metoprolol given ARF

63883,Given the recent allergy to Keflex we will obviously need to take a different antibiotic.
63884,She has been on dicloxacillin in the past with good result.
63885,Despite the  cross allergy of dicloxacillin compared to Keflex I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for now.
63886,If this does not work I think one should consider clindamycin for treatment.
63887,I will go ahead and give her  days worth of dicloxacillin
63888,and I instructing her to notify M.D. if she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.
63889,I also gave her  tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her prescription of Glucotrol XL .
63890,mg a day.
63891,She should see her PCP in two weeks.

65081,Goldfinch Lane Dothan VT     RE                   Walter Uribe HBH
65082,DOB                   Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan
65083,I am seeing this yearold gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.
65084,The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.
65085,The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.
65086,The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.
65087,He has never worn compression stockings.
65088,He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.
65089,To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.
65090,The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization long bone fractures or prior history of DVT.
65091,There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.
65092,He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.
65093,He has not been involved in any prolonged travel does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.
65094,The patients past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease congestive heart failure sleep apnea peripheral neuropathy morbid obesity hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
65095,His current medications include lisinopril verapamil metformin furosemide aspirin vitamin C Spiriva and Advair.
65096,The patient denies any family history of cancer thrombocytosis thrombocytopenia or bleeding.
65097,The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.
65098,He does not work denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.
65099,His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain dyspnea glasses diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
65100,On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.
65101,He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.
65102,He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.
65103,He has a huge protuberant abdomen.
65104,There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
65105,He has bounding carotid brachial and radial pulses.
65106,His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.
65107,On the left his dorsalis pedis is  and on the right his posterior tibial was .
65108,He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis which is greater on the left than the right.
65109,He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.
65110,He has severe brawny induration discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.
65111,The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.
65112,The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.
65113,The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.
65114,It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is  in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is  seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is  seconds.
65115,In the deep femoral vein common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.
65116,In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere  seconds in the proximal greater saphenous vein  seconds
65117,midthigh  seconds and distal thigh  seconds.
65118,In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is  seconds.
65119,Due to the patients size it was difficult to identify perforators.
65120,In summary we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.
65121,Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.
65122,I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.
65123,Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.
65124,This in addition to his morbid obesity that is a girth of  pounds that presses on his abdomen  hours a day seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.
65125,All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration ulceration and lower extremity swelling.
65126,The solution to this problem is not an easy one.
65127,With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.
65128,Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.
65129,If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no longterm benefit.
65130,I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with  to  inch ACE wraps.
65131,I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.
65132,I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care which are important.
65133,I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.
65134,It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.
65135,If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe please let me know.
65136,Sincerely       Michael D. Roe M.D.

65396,He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
65397,He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S S and no murmur rub or gallop.
65398,His abdomen is obese nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.
65399,His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.
65400,He has good distal pulsations.
65401,His carotids are  bilaterally without bruit.
65402,Laboratory values are not available today.
65403,ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of .
65404,He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.
65405,No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.
65406,He does have low voltage in his limb leads consistent with his morbid obesity.
65407,Impression
65408,Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant yearold gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors notably insulindependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.
65409,This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity which I estimate to be  to  METS.
65410,Most recently given his hip and orthopedic issues he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.
65411,However prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.
65412,However given his multiple risk factors notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.
65413,As such I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.
65414,If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.
65415,This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery which is scheduled for .
65416,With regards to his medication his blood pressure still is not at goal below .
65417,As such I have increased his ToprolXL from  mg to
65418,mg p.o.
65419,daily.
65420,This medication should be continued through all surgery.
65421,Additionally if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below  I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix  mg
65422,p.o.
65423,daily or hydrochlorothiazide  mg p.o.
65424,daily.
65425,Additionally it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.
65426,His last Ac was approximately
65427,and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.
65428,I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.
65429,With regards to his hypertension he is on multiple agents including ToprolXL Aldactone Avapro and minoxidil.
65430,Given the multitude of agents it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.
65431,We could consider in the future if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.
65432,Additionally if he is found to have coronary artery disease one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.
65433,As mentioned I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.
65434,I will follow back with him in approximately several months time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.
65435,Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.
65436,He has been provided both my email and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.
65437,Thank you.

65655,Union City CT
65656,Dear Dr. Pagan
65657,Your patient Lauren Ferrara came into the office today for a followup visit.
65658,As you know she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts.
65659,Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously but was successfully restored by Dr. Tejeda.
65660,In  we had detected a highgrade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty.
65661,A subsequent ultrasound study done in  showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic.
65662,She is not particularly active.
65663,She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms.
65664,Recently however her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes.
65665,She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications.
65666,She is a nonsmoker.
65667,On examination today she appeared well and in good spirits.
65668,Blood pressure was measured at  in the right arm.
65669,Lower extremity pulses are  at the femoral level bilaterally.
65670,On the right there is a strong easily appreciated pulse over her popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft and the foot is warm and well perfused.
65671,On the left I could not appreciate a pulse over her bypass graft incisions.
65672,The left foot is slightly cooler than the right and there are some mild cyanotic changes on the first toe in particular.
65673,There are no frank or impending ulcerations or areas of irreversible ischemia.
65674,There is a strong Doppler signal obtained over the posterior tibial artery at the ankle with an occlusion pressure of approximately  mmHg.
65675,This yields an ankle index of nearly .
65676,and maybe falsely elevated.
65677,A followup ultrasound study was performed in the vascular laboratory today.
65678,The right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent.
65679,As suspected the left lower extremity bypass has now demonstrated to be occluded.
65680,Ms. Ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft has occluded sometime during the last several months and her collateralization is clearly more marginal.
65681,At the present time she does not have any clearcut symptoms of critical limb ischemia though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign.
65682,The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit.
65683,Conversely she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated.
65684,I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be.
65685,At the present time however she appears to have marginal though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic.
65686,I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin.
65687,I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes rest pain or ulceration.
65688,At a minimum I will see her back in two months for reexamination but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation.
65689,If her collateralization can remain stable it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient.
65690,Thank you again for allowing us to participate in her care.
65691,Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.

65694,Ms. Ferrara returns for followup visit.
65695,She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm.
65696,Postoperatively she did well although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital
65697,and it was difficult to get her moving.
65698,She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm.
65699,According to the patient this was present early during her hospitalization but because of other issues it was not paid very much attention.
65700,She denies any significant pain in the leg.
65701,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
65702,On examination today she appears generally well.
65703,The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma whatsoever.
65704,The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses however she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition.
65705,She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function.
65706,The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle.
65707,The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing.
65708,She had a followup graft scan today which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing.
65709,The ankle index was measured at .
65710,on the left and .
65711,on the right.
65712,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
65713,Ms. Ferrara lower extremity circulation is stable and her bypass graft is functioning nicely.
65714,Unfortunately she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery.
65715,The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function.
65716,In any case she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things.
65717,There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection.
65718,We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed.

65806,IMPRESSION AND PLAN
65807,A yearold with a large right lung mass.
65808,This is likely to be malignant although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.
65809,At this point I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.
65810,Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub mm and may not be related to this malignancy.
65811,She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.
65812,I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.
65813,She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.
65814,She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.
65815,Otherwise she will follow up with Oncology.
65816,If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.

67168,Second opinion regarding painful legs with walking at less than  yards and also balance disorder.
67169,Interval History
67170,Mr.  Xavier Olive is a yearold gentleman who comes into Trumbull Memorial Vascular Center for a second opinion regarding his lower extremity discomfort and also his progressive difficulty walking and maintaining balance.
67171,His referring physician is Dr.  Ximena Keane practicing out of Alexandria Clinic.
67172,Mr.
67173,Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.
67174,He is  years old has history of diabetes starting in  known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort for which he has previously seen
67175,Dr.
67176,Cain at Alexandria Clinic and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital.
67177,Specifically he describes having been evaluated by Dr.  Cain and others some three or four years ago and undergoing at least two procedures all related to his legs cramping up.
67178,He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery so far as I can tell.
67179,The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center Big Rapids AC and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there.
67180,The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all.
67181,Currently he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast and this stops him at about  yards.
67182,The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsoniantype symptoms walking in a shuffle tipping forward and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely.
67183,His legs are rubbery and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens.
67184,It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything.
67185,At the same time his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication and he has known peripheral artery disease.
67186,Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up.
67187,The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature.
67188,Again there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication as to which is truly causing his disability.
67189,Past medical history     Diabetes onset in .
67190,Parkinsoniantype movement disorder followed by Dr.  Jeffers and Innis and for which he was placed on Sinemet presuming it was due to Parkinsons.
67191,The patient has not improved despite trying the medications.
67192,MRI at AC starting in  has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy unchanged.
67193,Status post vertebrobasilar TIA by report.
67194,Neuropathy documented by EMG in  with no spinal stenosis by MRI.
67195,Cervical spondylosis.
67196,Tracheal tumor resection in  performed via a suprasternal incision.

67232,No significant weight loss or anorexia.
67233,No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy.

67268,The toe brachial index drops to .
67269,on the right side and .
67270,at  minute after exercise.
67271,I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual anklebrachial indices were not measured following exercise.
67272,EKG      demonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of .
67273,There is normal axis and intervals with no evidence of prior infraction and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay.
67274,Other Data     DOB .
67275,Assessment and plan     Lower extremity arterial disease PADthe patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides.
67276,Currently complains of symptoms that sound like claudication predominantly involving the calves on both sides right slightly ahead of the left and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA.
67277,Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest I suspect he does not have preocclusion of the SFA for example.
67278,On the other hand he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated.
67279,His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than  yards and stops him at that point and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder possible Parkinsons disease.
67280,I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment.

67776,Platteville HI      RE    Isabelle Y. Quick
67777,ATCH       Dear Harry and Yair
67778,My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.
67779,As you know she is just  years of age.
67780,Her cardiovascular risk factors include type  diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide hypertension hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.
67781,She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.
67782,She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.
67783,She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.
67784,On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of  she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fempop bypass graft.
67785,This reconstruction is functioning well as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.
67786,In April of  she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fempop bypass graft to the aboveknee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.
67787,There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.
67788,She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.
67789,By last spring i.e. a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.
67790,She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.
67791,Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.
67792,Recently resting ABIs were recorded at . on the right
67793,and .
67794,on the left.
67795,Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion  length thereof
67796,she did not bring the films themselves and a patent albeit small reconstituted aboveknee popliteal artery with decent runoff.
67797,Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.
67798,She has sought an opinion here in this regard.
67799,She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in  for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.
67800,On physical examination blood pressure was .
67801,Pulse was  and regular.
67802,Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.
67803,She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fempop bypass graft in situ is palpable as is the left popliteal pulse.
67804,There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.
67805,She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.
67806,This is of course a very unhappy situation.
67807,Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.
67808,However I am not absolutely ruling this out.
67809,I would suggest the following.
67810,Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor aspirin and Plavix.
67811,Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.
67812,She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.
67813,If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.
67814,I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.
67815,My thanks once again.
67816,With every best wish.
67817,Sincerely      Daniel W. Iniguez M.D.

68606,Stroke.
68607,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
68608,This is a yearold righthanded woman with a history of hypertension diabetes and hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the Neurology Service on  with rightarm weakness and difficulty speaking.
68609,She presented to the Emergency Room .
68610,hours after last seeming normal.
68611,Her initial NI stroke scale was .
68612,She was admitted to the Neurology Service for a stroke workup.
68613,Her imaging studies showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata head of the caudate basal ganglia and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA in addition to a left ICA occlusion.
68614,She was taken to angiogram for interventional neuroradiology.
68615,She had an angiogram.
68616,Radiology felt they were unable to access the cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and hypertensive therapy.
68617,She remained stable anticoagulated on heparin.
68618,During the hospital stay she spontaneously converted to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation which was felt to be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to remain anticoagulated.
68619,She was discharged to rehab and subsequently went home from rehab on .
68620,At home she had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been feeling O.K.
68621,VNA sees her once a week.
68622,At rehab for unclear reasons her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic this was done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is unaware of any such problems.
68623,She continues to get PT and occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory remains poor.
68624,According to the family member and her daughter who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today she continues to have rightsided weakness although significantly improved and decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able to communicate well with her.
68625,Since her discharge she has not had any new episodes of numbness weakness headaches or visual changes.

68688,IMPRESSION
68689,This is a yearold woman with significant vascular risk factors including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory infarct.
68690,On exam she has residual aphasia involving both comprehension and fluency and a moderate right hemiparesis.
68691,It is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during her hospital
68692,stay
68693,I think that she would benefit from anticoagulation therapy.
68694,I have asked her to get a follow up PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are any contraindications to anticoagulation.
68695,If there are no such contraindications she should restart on warfarin.
68696,In addition her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask her to increase her Captopril to .
68697,mg t.i.d.
68698,and to maintain a blood pressure diary.
68699,RECOMMENDATIONS .
68700,Continue antihypertensive and increase Captopril to .
68701,mg t.i.d. .
68702,Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment. .
68703,Continue risk factor modification with the management of blood pressure diabetes and hypercholesterol as she is doing. .
68704,PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications per the PCP. .
68705,Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait training and language rehab. .
68706,Return to clinic in  months or sooner if there are any new problems.
68707,More than  of this clinic visit was spent on patient education and counseling.

68790,SDH    ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATIONS   yearold woman with vascular risk factors including atrial fibrillation and prior stroke  with a subsequent SDH with super elevated INR who now returns for followup.
68791,She has had a significant recovery.
68792,Our goal should now be secondary stroke prevention and risk factor modification.
68793,Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR it is worth considering restarting warfarin  until then she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them.
68794,She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well.
68795,She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr Queen for this.
68796,RTC as needed.
68797,Call with questions.
68798,More than  of this visit was spent on patient education and counseling.

68994,INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN
68995,The patient is a yearold female  with history of prior stroke hypertension diabetes and  paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presents with altered mental  status and urinary incontinence.
68996,Differential diagnosis at this  time includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality.
68997,The  patient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and  as per review of prior notes.
68998,Repeat stroke is certainly on the  differential however I have a lower suspicion then for a  metabolic or infectious etiology.
68999,The patient will need to have  a large workup including laboratory studies urine studies Foley  catheter portable chest xray and repeat noncontrast head CT  scan.
69000,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE
69001,Upon arrival to the Emergency  Department the patient had history and physical exam performed.
69002,The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid  ventricular response.
69003,The patients lead EKG revealed a rate  of  beats per minute atrial fibrillation with rapid  ventricular response stable Twave inversions noted over the  lateral leads as well as over the precordial leads.
69004,No definite  ST segment abnormalities were noted.
69005,The patient then had a  portable chest xray and as per report the patients portable  chest xray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or  findings.
69006,The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and
69007,the patients noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some  rightsided edema.
69008,The patient will have this followed up with  an MRI of the brain.
69009,The patients laboratory studies were  notable for sodium of  and potassium of ..
69010,The patients  lactic acid was ..

69014,The patients first  set of cardiac markers were negative.
69015,The patients coagulation  studies were normal.
69016,The patient was treated with ceftriaxone  for her urinary tract infection.
69017,The patient could possibly have  urosepsis given her fever and tachycardia.
69018,Urine sepsis is my  leading diagnosis at this time.
69019,The patients rightsided edema  is certainly concerning however I do not feel that the patient  will need to be admitted to Neurology at this time.
69020,The patient  will be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis.
69021,The patient  will need to be admitted to a monitor bed.
69022,The patients blood  pressure is normal and as such I do not feel that the patient  needs an intensive care unit bed.
69023,In terms the patients atrial  fibrillation with rapid ventricular response the patient was  given metoprolol IV.

69124,She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L. foot infections and ulcerations in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM.
69125,She originally sustained a R. th metatarsal fracture in  with poor union and subsequent fracture of her nd  th metatarsals.
69126,She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R. lateral metatarsal heads with underlying osteomyelitisthis did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics.
69127,She underwent ID of her R. foot ulceration in  OR cultures grew P. aeruginosa.
69128,In  she underwent debridement of her chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting.
69129,In  she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing th metatarsal osteomyelitis along with excision of her th metatarsalbone cultures grew MSSA.
69130,She did well until  when she underwent R. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot calcaneal osteotomy lateral translation dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.
69131,She subsequently developed a R. heel ulceration and in  underwent debridement of this ulceration removal of a screw and placement of a vacuum sponge.
69132,Her wound continued to heal poorly and she underwent R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting.
69133,In  she underwent debridement of her R. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft which has taken well she feels that her R. heel has been healing nicely.
69134,During her long hospitalization in  she started developing L. heel and L. forefoot ulcerations.
69135,She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically.
69136,These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months and she presented with cellulitis of this area in .
69137,She received vancomycin levofloxacin flagyl initially then augmentin with persistent poor healing of her wounds.
69138,On  she underwent operative debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcershe was found to have extensive necrotic yellowbrown tissue underlying her L. heel eschar which was extensively debrided she received a course of linezolid postoperatively.
69139,She had an angiogram on  which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE and good flow through her prior R. SFA to posterior tibial bypas graft.
69140,She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently she feels that her R. heel is almost completely healed and that her L. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously.
69141,Her L. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past.
69142,Over the past  days she developed fairly acute swelling erythema and pain around her forefoot ulcer with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot.
69143,She was seen in vascular surgery clinic and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement.

69459,Note    I have seen and examined the patient with Dr. Titus and I agree with her evaluation and plan as outlined above.
69460,Mr. Aguilar is a  yo man with ho CF with mild pulmonary disease who presented to an OSH on  with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias followed by a loss of left visual field diplopia and left sided weakness.
69461,The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness.
69462,The patient was evaluated at the OSH with noncontrast head CT and LP which were significant only for elevated CSF protein.
69463,Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam.
69464,Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis otherwise neurologic exam nonfocal.
69465,Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles.
69466,DDX for above includes ischemic process though symptoms appear to be multifocal vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process.
69467,Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms or meningeal process.
69468,We plan to obtain CNS MRI neuro consult.
69469,Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic workup.
69470,Continue maintenance medications for CF.

69955,Assessment  yo M with DMII CHF EF  afib Parkinsons prostate cancer sp XRT cb proctitis and GIB multiple hip replacements recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis    who presented  sp fall.
69956,With regards to his shoulder it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the week abx course.
69957,Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam  months after completion of his course it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis.
69958,The MRI is difficult to interpret and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.
69959,He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers though confounded by multiple comorbidities.
69960,Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically off abx for signs of recurrent infection.
69961,However given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder.
69962,As such would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.
69963,The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated and blood cultures were negative.
69964,However such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected.
69965,This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.
69966,Alternatively he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis.
69967,Recommendations  hold antibiotics including preoperative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data
69968,Aspirate shoulder.
69969,Send fluid for cell counts Gram stain aerobicanaerobicfungal cultures
69970,if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement  would obtain hip biopsies in the OR again off abx to assess for possible hip infection  likewise would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement  check CK given elevated Cr following fall and possible rhabdo

70604,Diabetes continues to be a problem.
70605,Glycemic control continues to be difficult to achieve.
70606,Today I have reinstated metformin at

70608,q.d.
70609,The son is going to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she is not taking this medicine at this point.
70610,The other medications were continued.
70611,It is indeed possible that she will need insulin in the near future.
70612,I plan close followup and will see her again in six weeks time.
70613,If she is hyperthyroid this may also explain the difficulty in achieving glycemic control.
70614,Against this is the high cholesterol.
70615,She used to be on Lipitor which was discontinued during her trip to Ghana.
70616,I have reinstated the Lipitor today

70766,Dear Doctor Trejo    I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient Mr. Tyler Pearson in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here today.
70767,As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia.
70768,He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint.
70769,He has had no focal motor sensory deficits and no amaurosis fugax.
70770,A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time.
70771,Assessment and plan
70772,Overall I am extremely pleased with Mr. Pearsons outcome given his high risk pulmonary status.
70773,It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months time with a repeat carotid duplex examination.
70774,I would be happy to assist in the management of this or any of your other patients as you deem necessary in the future.
70775,Thank you again for allowing me to assist in his care.
70776,If I can be of any further assistance please feel free to contact either myself or one of my partners directly.

72138,Reason for consultation   Diabetes gastroparesis     HPI  yo woman with poorlycontrolled DM diagnosed  and ho gastroparesis retinopathy nephropathy peripheral neuropathy and  with multiple visits and three recent admissions for nvgastroparesis May and June  July .
72139,Her GI symptoms began in December .
72140,Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study with  emptying at  minutes and  emptying at  minutes.
72141,Originally she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since  initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus.
72142,After her admission June  she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus
72143,U qhs  metformin  bid.
72144,HbAC was .
72145,more recently it has been .
72146,in  and . on .
72147,On her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately  days ago gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting.
72148,Glycemic control however was poor and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale and this was too complex for her.
72149,Accordingly and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin Ac above  we changed her reigimen to NPH  Units BID.
72150,Her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy nephropathy with microalbuminuria neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet and no known macrovascular disease.
72151,Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy but is often multifactorial.
72152,She was readmitted to the PSH on  after having  days of nausea vomiting and anorexia.
72153,She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED and was admitted for management.
72154,On ROSystems and history she reports that she had been taking her new  insulin  units BID.
72155,Sugars had been running s all the time s no better or worse.
72156,Nausea per her report began suddenly on Friday evening  and got gradually worse.
72157,Currently nausea has abated but abdominal pain persists.
72158,Written only for insulin sliding scale.
72159,Glucose  on admission with anion gap of  that closed rapidly with hydration.

72243,Impression   F with poorly controlled type II DM and known neuropathy nephropathy retinopathy and gastroparesis repeated admission for nausea vomiting poor nutrition.
72244,Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of  with anion gap of .
72245,Rapidly closed anion gap to  with hydration alone.
72246,Abdominal pain can be multifactorial.
72247,I dont doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility but differential includes small bowel angina pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky hepatobiliary disease.
72248,With normal anion gap I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut but small bowel angina is still a possibility.
72249,Recommendations
72250,Gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility.
72251,a. Would not hold long acting insulin.
72252,Start NPH U BID    dose if NPO
72253,b. While NPO have D running in IVF once fingerstick drops below  especially once NPH started.
72254,If she needs IVF at a higher rate you might run DNS at cchour along with NS or    NS at whatever rate is needed.
72255,c. Continue sliding scale insulin QH when NPO QAC and QHS when eating but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows
72256,i. Fingerstick   units   units   units   units   units   units.
72257,d.
72258,Start mealtime insulin clearly hold while NPO of U regular prebreakfast and predinner.
72259,Hold if NPO or PO intake poor.
72260,She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating.
72261,e. No metformin for now given GI upset.
72262,Agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient including ativan reglan zofran PRN zelnorm miralax colace.
72263,For crude ro of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac.
72264,Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year but this does not exclude small bowel angina.
72265,Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels.
72266,I do not think this is warranted at this point but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.
72267,With hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia would check TSH though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response.
72268,Thank you for the consult.
72269,We will follow with you.
72270,Please call with any questions.

72278,She has been treated with multiple medications including Reglan Ativan Compazine and Zelnorm without much effect.
72279,She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping.
72280,The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December
72281,but then it did not seem to be working as well.
72282,The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent.
72283,She has been unable to return to work for  years because of the pain and she would like to be able to do so.
72284,The pain is not necessarily related to eating.
72285,Yesterday she felt well and was able to eat.
72286,Today she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin
72287,and then it escalated to an .

72412,HISTORY As provided in the header.
72413,COMPARISON       TECHNIQUE      Contiguous axial CT scans of both the abdomen and pelvis were      performed from the lung bases to the proximal femora to assess for      obstruction.
72414,Imaging was continued into the pelvis because a charge can affect      both cavities.
72415,Abdominal and pelvic images were obtained following administration      of both oral and intravenous contrast.
72416,FINDINGS      LUNG BASES.
72417,Linear densities in the lung bases likely represents      atelectasis.

72469,GI Pain is responsive to morphine.
72470,Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
72471,Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative.
72472,She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract.
72473,Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis.
72474,We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.
72475,She did have a negative antiendomysial Ab in
72476,but I think it would be worth checking both antiendomysial Ab and antigliadin Ab to ru celiac sprue again.
72477,We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to fu on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital. .
72478,HTN  BP is very elevated today and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine which may have been given to help with GI motility.

72801,AssessmentPlan
72802,This is a  year old woman with past medical history of DM chronic immunosuppresion steroid use RA HTN ho leg ulcers cellulitis and osteomyelitis who presents with a  week history of left lower extremity swelling and erythema without other symptomatic complaints that has been resistant to po treatment .
72803,Cellulitis  this woman is predisposed to cellulitis for a number of reasons including chronic immunosuppression diabetes and prior surgeries to the area that have altered the anatomy and blood supply and lymphatic drainage.
72804,Other potential causes include osteo or DVT.
72805,At this point there is little to suspect osteo in this patient.
72806,a. Blood cultures b.
72807,Given her multiple problems requires broad spectrum coverage  Zosyn .
72808,g IV q h CrCl
72809,c. Elevate the leg d.
72810,Warm compresses to increased circulation e. Mark the extent of cellulitis and monitor progression with therapy f.
72811,If cellulitis does not improve  will get imaging to evaluate for underlying infection.
72812,Will also get LENIS to rule out a DVT. .
72813,Weight loss anorexia night sweats now with R kidney mass
72814,the differential for potential causes is very broad.
72815,She apparently had a negative PPD last year.
72816,Extensive workup to date was only notable for kidney cysts and mass a. Will attempt to schedule IRguided biopsy b. Will stop ASA plavix and celebrex in anticipation of the biopsy c. Continue to monitor fever curve .
72817,Diabetes  patient is taking in normal diet however in the setting of infection will  put of home meds and do RISSFSG .
72818,HTN  continue Lisinopril .
72819,RA  continue Prednisone and Methotrexate
