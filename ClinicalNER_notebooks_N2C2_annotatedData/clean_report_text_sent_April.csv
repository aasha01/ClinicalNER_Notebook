668,Re Umstead Kenneth MR Dear Jac I saw your patient Kenneth Umstead in the Cardiology office today and he seems to be doing very well from a cardiovascular perspective
669,Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps
670,Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed
671,This has been reevaluated and he has been stable
672,The fourth polyp will need to be removed at a later time
673,At this point his aspirin has been discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests
674,His current medications therefore include Lasix mg per day Metoprolol mg qd
675,Nifedipine XL
676,mg qd
677,He is aware of a belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no exertional or other related symptoms
678,He is reasonably active but somewhat limited by his claudication
679,On exam today he is comfortable with a blood pressure of a heart rate of and regular
680,Head and neck were unremarkable
681,Chest is clear
682,Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension at degrees
683,PMI is normal
684,S and S are normal with a physiologic split
685,There is an S and a IVI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border
686,Abdominal exam was unremarkable
687,Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis
688,His resting lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left intraventricular conduction delay
689,Jacob Bautista M.D
690,Re Umstead Kenneth July Page I think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well
691,It would be of value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since
692,He had minimal ischemia at that time
693,There are no symptoms that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings
694,If any problems develop please dont hesitate to contact me

807,This is a yearold gentleman with a history of multiple medical problems
808,The ones most pertinent to us currently are
809,RACHAEL G. OBRYAN M.D
810,VALLEJO GENERAL HOSPITAL ENDOCRINOLOGY DIVISION Workman Edwin Lunar Lane Brookshire MO Page the fact that he is posttransplant has several risk factors for osteoporosis including prednisone use and a family history of osteoporosis
811,The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it is about a yearandahalf or so with half a year during his chemotherapy years ago and then about a year since his transplant
812,The patients history of never having had fractures no bone pain
813,no height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant patients
814,However getting a bone density study in the patient like this makes sense
815,We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on his follow up visit since he cannot have one today for scheduling reasons
816,We will also check vitamin D levels given patients history of renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to do for him is to give him vitamin D
817,His calcium intake was estimated to be about mg
818,a day including one cup of milk green leafy vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day
819,We would be a little reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure without more information about this patient
820,The patients diabetes seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under fairly good control sounding like they are in the range although we dont have access to hemoglobin AC
821,Given the fact that it sounds like he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz we will not pursue this at the current time unless asked and we will focus primarily on the bone situation
822,Otherwise we will see the patient back or at least talk to RACHAEL G. OBRYAN M.D. VALLEJO GENERAL HOSPITAL ENDOCRINOLOGY DIVISION Workman Edwin Lunar Lane Brookshire

829,As you are aware he is a year old man who is a convenience store manager
830,He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years mainly related to sports injuries
831,He has had in particular years of pain now in his right knee
832,It got so bad months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that
833,It has slowly got better since then
834,At present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with activity but he also has rest and night pain
835,He has a restricted walking distance
836,With regard to function he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work
837,He has noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed
838,With regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of Tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to have a colonoscopy in the near future
839,He has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet
840,On examination I note he has bilateral varus knees worse on the right than the left
841,He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust
842,He has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of arthritis
843,He has a degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to degrees
844,His varus deformity is not fully correctable
845,He has grade quadriceps power
846,Xrays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete obliteration of joint space on the right side
847,I note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic
848,We have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial osteotomy a unicompartmental knee replacement and a total knee replacement
849,At present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe enough to warrant operative intervention
850,We would certainly reconsider should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee instilling some corticosteroids
851,We have advised him that this will only provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight
852,We have organized to see him again in months time at which stage we will reassess him
853,Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the knee and instill some corticosteroid
854,With kind regards

1088,Record date August Aiden Geiger M.D. Friendship Villa Care Center Hyannis Street Sioux City FL RE Vivian Lea Jorgenson MR Dear Dr. Geiger Thank you for referring your patient Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September
1089,As you know she is a year old woman with hypertension hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease
1090,She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has increased in size it is felt to be a potential malignancy and she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September of this year
1091,In terms of her cardiac history she was well until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart failure
1092,At that time she had an exercise Thallium scan which revealed a low work load at only minutes stopping secondary to shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a dilated left ventricle
1093,In addition she had an echo in June of which shows an ejection fraction of with mitral regurgitation left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction
1094,She has never been hospitalized since that time for her congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good result
1095,She currently denies any orthopnea PND angina or claudication
1096,She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema
1097,In fact she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her recollection
1098,She is able to walk up the stairs to her house and can unload groceries from her car up those stairs
1099,She is able to shop walk through the grocery store without difficulty from chest Jorgenson Vivian Lea MR August pains or shortness of breath although she occasionally stops secondary to fatigue
1100,Her past medical history includes hypertension hyperlipidemia CHF chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule
1101,She has never had surgery
1102,Her family history is significant for a mother who died of myocardial infarction at the age of
1103,Her social history she smoked packs of cigarettes a day for years and quit four years ago
1104,She denies alcohol intravenous drugs or cocaine use
1105,She lives with her husband and briefly worked in Amys Baking Company but for the past years is an electrical engineer
1106,She has no known drug allergies
1107,Her current medications include Labetalol mg po BID Captopril po TID Digoxin .mg
1108,po QD
1109,Coumadin po QD
1110,Lipitor po QD
1111,Lasix po QD Coreg
1112,po BID Nitroglycerin patch daily and Gemfibrozil mg BID
1113,On physical exam in my office her blood pressure was in her left arm and in her right
1114,Her heart rate was when I saw her although it was on her EKG today
1115,Her JVP was centimeters
1116,Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid bruits
1117,Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles
1118,Her heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with occasional ectopic beats
1119,She has a normal S and S with a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without radiation
1120,Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds
1121,Her extremities have distal pulses and trace peripheral edema
1122,Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of
1123,She has a diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin effects
1124,She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes
1125,In summary Ms. Jorgenson is a year old woman with hypertension hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial infarction although she has never undergone heart catheterization
1126,She is currently undergoing evaluation for a thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule
1127,Jorgenson Vivian Lea MR August Issue number one preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden since I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with imaging
1128,If this is similar to her previous study showing only fixed defects and no reversible ischemia then I feel that she will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is well treated and therefore will not preclude her from having surgery
1129,Issue number two is her anticoagulation for low ejection fraction
1130,She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection fraction
1131,As far as I know she has never had atrial fibrillation and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or rhythm
1132,Therefore I recommend that she stop her Coumadin days prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons as to how may days she should wait after surgery before restarting that medication
1133,She will otherwise remain on her current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and primary care physician Dr. Charles Van
1134,If her stress test is without reversible defects she need not follow up with me for further evaluation
1135,Thank you for referring this interesting patient
1136,She was seen and examined with Dr. Voss

1143,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
1144,He has seen Dr. Jose Quirk and a prostate biopsy has been recommended
1145,This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it
1146,He began the Captopril and HCTZ or Maxide and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH
1147,At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved
1148,He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself
1149,His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the to range fasting
1150,On one occasion a three hour postprandial was
1151,He has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this
1152,He has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month

1155,His blood pressure is right arm sitting with regular pulse of
1156,His weight is stable
1157,IMPRESSION Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program

1308,Caroll St Bluefield ME Dear Dr. Easterling I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service on
1309,He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and I believe Dr. Inglis
1310,He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning
1311,His episodes of chest pain are interesting
1312,He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching
1313,The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset
1314,They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge
1315,He is otherwise in fairly good health

1341,Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits
1342,Assessment and plan Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort
1343,Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se
1344,It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past
1345,We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed
1346,I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress

1449,Re Horn Gregory BCC Unit Dear Dr. Givens
1450,I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Horn in followup regarding possible interstitial lung disease
1451,He has managed to lose lbs
1452,on his own personal diet plan and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control
1453,His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm grading it as out of vs. out of to which his wife agrees
1454,They both attribute it to the Prilosec
1455,He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge
1456,He has no snoring daytime hypersomnolence or morning headaches no longer falls asleep at work
1457,Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident
1458,No lower extremity edema swollen glands or fevers
1459,Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping
1460,On examination he is well appearing
1461,Respiratory rate and unlabored
1462,Blood pressure with a small cuff
1463,Conjunctivae are clear
1464,Oropharynx is clear
1465,Trachea is midline no goiter or adenopathy
1466,Back Normal configuration
1467,Chest Normal percussion note good air movement bilaterally fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases
1468,Cardiac Faint left parasternal impulse mildly prominent P normal S S without murmur rub or gallop
1469,JVP is cm with borderline HJR
1470,Abdomen Soft nontender no hepatosplenomegaly or mass
1471,Extremities
1472,No cyanosis or edema borderline clubbing
1473,Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry a slight down in total lung capacity but still approximately predicted and DLCO stable in the predicted range
1474,My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules
1475,Impression
1476,Interstitial lung disease Mild objective impairment by functional status
1477,Pulmonary function tests Overall these were stable and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis
1478,However as I reviewed with the patient and his wife it is well established that of the time another disorder such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy
1479,There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration other than that associated with GE reflux to explain his lung disease
1480,He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon although this likely would necessitate lowdose steroids the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.
1481,GE reflux
1482,This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis
1483,If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle he can have very good control of this.
1484,Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.
1485,Possible sleep disorder Currently is entirely without symptoms now that his reflux is well controlled.
1486,Chronic cough.
1487,Diabetes Better controlled.
1488,Obesity He continues to need aggressive weight loss program
1489,As I mentioned to him he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight but he is starting to make some progress
1490,Recommendations
1491,Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d
1492,dosing as well as lifestyle modifications including marked decrease in caffeine intake.
1493,Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.
1494,Cardiovascular evaluation by you prior to his surgery would be appreciated
1495,It has been a pleasure to participate in his care
1496,Please feel free to call with any questions or comments
1497,Sincerely Paul N. Tam M.D. PNTivesteryanez

1567,We also discussed that she continue her own exercise both of which she does faithfully and we also discussed the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight
1568,She currently weighs lbs. and stands approximately tall
1569,As far as longterm prognosis my current plan is to evaluate her blood pressure on another subsequent visit in the next weeks and at that time if it is elevated we will consider either going up on her nifedipine XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine seeing if we can possibly gain some better control or possibly adding another agent
1570,However at this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood pressure on her first admission which was systolic blood pressures in the ss
1571,Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation now appears to be much more stable

1582,He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH
1583,Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT
1584,Apparently he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments
1585,The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan all of which were negative
1586,He has the reports here with him
1587,The bone scan does show an abnormality at L but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion
1588,He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis
1589,This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him
1590,He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week however is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done
1591,Impression In reviewing the patients limited records that he brings and his history it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH
1592,I have reassured him of this and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future
1593,I also informed him that he will likely need antiandrogen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA

1709,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
1710,This is a year old woman with diabetes and obesity
1711,Her problems are as follows
1712,Diabetes
1713,She was sent to me from OBGYN because of her high glucose and she was put on insulin by me
1714,Xitlali Xia followed her in order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls
1715,She finally comes back and I am relieved but she has not brought any list of her blood sugars
1716,She says she does take them about twice a day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and threw them away
1717,She says that they never go higher than that they usually are about
1718,It was this morning before breakfast she says
1719,She says it does get as low as and five or six times it has been below
1720,She does say she eats three regular meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten breakfast she said no
1721,She is seeing a nutritionist this morning
1722,I will check a hemoglobin AC today
1723,I expressed to her again how important it is that she eat three regular meals but not sweets
1724,She had been eating a lot of chocolate
1725,She says she has gotten off of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it then
1726,She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will help her with her diet
1727,If her diet does get better maybe we can wean her off the insulin and try Micronase
1728,I explained to her too that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might be able to get her off the insulin
1729,This seemed to be something that she would like to do
1730,Hopefully the nutritionist can help
1731,I also told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her to take her blood sugar before breakfast lunch dinner and sleep and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was really going on and whether they are getting too low
1732,She denies any kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as
1733,I am wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly
1734,She had no shakiness no loss of consciousness no dizziness no nothing
1735,She felt totally normal
1736,So hopefully she will really record these and we will get a better idea
1737,She said this always happens in the morning
1738,She kept contradicting herself and had no documentation
1739,I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia
1740,Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick
1741,She does drink juice but I went over the symptoms again with her
1742,She will call me if she does have any.
1743,Left ankle pain
1744,I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested
1745,She said that she may do some surgery on her.
1746,Dysuria
1747,She says this is totally resolved after giving her the Bactrim.
1748,Yeast infection
1749,She said this has also resolved.
1750,She complains of headache
1751,She says these have been going on for two or three months that light and noise bother her when she has some
1752,She has had nausea and vomited once
1753,This happened pretty much every day and it can be at any time of the day
1754,Tylenol and Advil did not help
1755,She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there
1756,But she has no further prodrome
1757,She says it is a banging kind of pain that is rhythmic
1758,She also says she does see stars in front of her eyes when it happens
1759,I asked her if she had any hearing loss and she said that she hears voices but people are not there sometimes
1760,It has been happening for a couple of weeks
1761,I discussed this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like migraines
1762,I will not image her head now as there is no evidence that this would be something to do with brain tumor
1763,Her neuro exam was totally normal
1764,Cranial nerves IIXII were checked and intact
1765,Her gait was normal
1766,Light touch was touched
1767,Her toes were downgoing
1768,Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally
1769,Her disks were sharp
1770,EOMI PERRL
1771,I gave her a prescription for Motrin mg PO t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind her left ear
1772,I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
1773,Health maintenance
1774,I thought that since she is diabetic and obese that she might benefit from a flu shot
1775,She has no interest in this at all
1776,Her blood pressure was in the left arm with a thigh cuff

2436,Dear Dr. Long Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic
2437,I had the pleasure of seeing her on November
2438,Please allow me to summarize her history for our records
2439,Ms. Vincent is a yearold mother of eight with chronic renal failure of unknown etiology
2440,She is six years status post hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult leiomyosarcoma was discovered
2441,She has an extensive history of hidradenitis obesity and hypertension
2442,She had one stillborn infant one premature infant and three spontaneous abortions
2443,SFOC records are unavailable at this time
2444,Her medications include Premarin
2446,Diltiazem qd furosemide
2448,qd Mevacor mg qd Calcitriol
2451,Niferex mg
2453,Vitamin E units qd fish oil qd and Keflex mg qid
2454,On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a yearold woman in no distress
2455,Her weight is . kilograms or lbs
2456,Temperature is normal
2457,Pulse is beats per minute
2458,Blood pressure is
2459,There is striking hirsutism and moon facies
2460,There is a buffalo hump
2461,The lungs show scattered wheezing
2462,Cardiovascular exam is normal
2463,There are discolorations of the skin across the neck upper extremities and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not raised
2464,The abdomen is obese without palpable masses
2465,There is a ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen
2466,The extremities show trace edema
2467,There are several areas of superficial petechiae
2468,In summary this yearold woman has chronic renal failure of unclear etiology
2469,She does report an episode of lower extremity swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis
2470,ThisRoberta Vincent MR November raises the possibility of a postinfectious glomerulonephritis now in a chronic phase
2471,Other diagnostic possibilities include other forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions
2472,Nevertheless I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased risk due to her body habitus
2473,I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms. Vincent
2474,Although she has no medical conditions which would preclude livingrelated or cadaveric kidney transplantation her obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option
2475,I have encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or transplantation
2476,Nevertheless her appearance is quite reminiscent of Cushings disease and this should be worked up if it has not been performed previously
2477,I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her kidney function and a followup appointment in two months time to meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV fistula or placement of a graft

2563,The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance

2565,Pt was offered MRI today however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI he has tried before with medications
2566,Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and fu with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week

2587,Patient says he was diagnosed as having neuropsychiatric lupus in at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker Xian and was treated with steroids at the time
2588,Its not clear what CNS or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time
2589,Because of complex partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his estradiol level was in the s. His testosterone was up but available testosterone was down
2590,so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures
2591,Said he was doing fine until around weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred
2592,He said his neck felt full and warm
2593,His head felt like it was going to explode
2594,He had tinnitus excess saliva he felt that his lower jaw was vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasnt right
2595,Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and postnasal drip

2638,Abdomen no organs masses tenderness but obese
2639,Extremity joint exam fine
2640,Neurological fine
2641,I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection
2642,However I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and therefore have tested him for that and also for complement level to also exclude lupus and vasculitis
2643,Basically I told him to take Flonase twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip cleared up
2644,In the meantime continue on the Lamictal mg twice a day as a stabilizer Risperdal
2645,mg per day as a mood stabilizer the testolactone mg times a day to increase the availability of testosterone the Clomid clomiphene citrate mg per day to decrease estradiol Levoxyl mcg twice a day Altace mg twice a day regarding hypertension and ibuprofen mg twice a day for low back pain

2907,coronary artery disease After his admission for CHF he underwent dolbutamine stress test on which revealed a small area of ischemia in midanterior and a moderate to largesized area of ischemia inferiorly
2908,and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress
2909,Based on this he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization
2910,he underwent stenting X of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch
2911,Notably his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery

3109,Review of systems Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of chest pains over the last years
3110,However he does say that his last chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago
3111,When asked where the pain was he put his hand over this midepigastrium and stated that the pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his angioplasty
3112,He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet
3113,At the time he was just sitting on his couch watching television
3114,He has no history of exertional angina over the last several years
3115,However this complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina

3126,MHC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Orta Phil Page Assessment and Plan
3127,Cardiovascular
3128,Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina
3129,Given that he is on no current cardiac medication except for aspirin I will decide to initiate therapy with diltiazem CD mg PO q.d. in an attempt to control his blood pressure and heart rate
3130,I also encouraged him to continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future
3131,The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control
3132,After he has been on a stable dose for several days we will perform an outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any evidence of ischemia at this time
3133,If he does we will recommend a cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be causing syms of rest angina
3134,The case was discussed with any cardiacs that are on call.
3135,Given the patients history of coronary artery disease I sent an SMA level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does have with a cholesterol of and hypertriglyceridemia which he also has at a level of
3136,He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in the past however he has not been taking it for the last year
3137,I instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his diet and explained which food contain those products
3138,I will also initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides
3139,We will start him off on simvastatin mg PO q.d
3140,later this week.
3141,Daily anxiety
3142,Will continue the patients Ativan in an attempt to control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without Ativan.

3192,He is a yearold righthanded man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December with left arm weakness ataxia and dysarthria
3193,The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke
3194,An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata
3195,The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission despite being heparinized
3196,The following day he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side
3197,Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally
3198,There was no critical carotid stenosis
3199,He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction dilated left atrium very mild inferior hypokinesis and no patent foramen ovale
3200,He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias
3201,His cholesterol level was with an HDL of
3202,It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries
3203,He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis
3204,He had been on aspirin prior Plavix was added to his regimen
3205,Since his discharge from the hospital he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months
3206,He has had no further episodes of weakness numbness tingling ataxia dysarthria or dysphagia
3207,He has no symptoms of aphasia
3208,He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event which he feels has improved
3209,I would agree with him
3210,He also has regained some strength in the left leg and is currently working on using a walker with assistance
3211,Unfortunately he has not regained any use of the left arm
3212,He has not had any problems with spasms
3213,His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus
3214,He had an inferior myocardial infarction in
3215,He had a quadruple bypass in

3237,He had been on Captopril earlier
3238,but he has since been taken off that medicine
3239,He was managed with insulin during his prior admission
3240,I assume he is still on this medicine although he did not specifically state so
3241,He has an allergy to sulfa drugs
3242,The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery
3243,The patient quit smoking years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions
3244,There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers but no family history of stroke
3245,On examination he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress
3246,His blood pressure was
3247,His language was intact
3248,His speech was somewhat dysarthric although this was improved from his admission
3249,He was alert and oriented
3250,His conversation was appropriate
3251,The visual fields were full
3252,The pupils were equal and reactive at mm
3253,Facial sensation was normal
3254,There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop
3255,The tongue and palate were midline
3256,The patient had flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm
3257,There was atrophy of the left biceps
3258,There was full range of motion of the joints
3259,The patient had left iliopsoas hip extensors left quadriceps left ankle dorsiflexors and ankle plantar flexors
3260,The tone in the lower extremities was not increased
3261,His right side was
3262,He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe
3263,His right toe was downgoing
3264,Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick
3265,I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy
3266,Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes
3267,He was in a wheelchair and his gait was not assessed
3268,Mr. Parrishs recovery is progressing
3269,He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker
3270,I hope that this will be the case
3271,Unfortunately his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement
3272,I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness
3273,His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries
3274,I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled as has been done and to continue an anticholesterol agent
3275,I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while
3276,The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol
3277,I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way
3278,However since he has been on this medicine so long it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well
3279,He should continue on an aspirin a day
3280,He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost
3281,I recommended to him that in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type
3282,We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this
3283,This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal
3284,After six months if he has had no further clinical events it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin
3285,I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months
3286,I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one years time
3287,The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination

3484,Mr. Austin is a year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador days ago
3485,He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina
3486,While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe midsternal pain without diaphoresis pain radiated to the left upper arm and patient discribed it as sharp burning pressure
3487,He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within minutes
3488,There days later pain reccurred again it lasted about minutes but this time he went to ED
3489,An EKG was normal and he was discharged on NG
3490,Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized
3491,On July st he was catheterized and found to have diffuse CAD involving several vessels
3492,Stent placement was not attempted
3493,His LV EF was and he was transferred to a medical ward
3494,A day later on July rd he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July on the following medication ASA mg Plavix

3504,mg po bid Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital
3505,He then experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes
3506,It is worth noting that ETT here in was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was was read as not suggestive of ischemia
3507,Testing performed STRESS ECHO DOPPLER COLOR DOPPLER MMode D Quality Conclusion
3508,Patient exercised min sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol reaching stage and stopped secondary to fatigue
3509,No chest pain was reported
3510,Maximal heart rate attained was bpm of maximum HR predicted for age and BP at peak exercise was
3511,The maximum ratepressure product was See exercise report for full ECG details
3512,Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm
3513,There were mm horizontalupsloping ST depressions in leads V and lead II at peak exercise Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals Normal left ventricular size and systolic function
3514,Estimated resting ejection fraction is
3515,No resting segmental wall motion abnormalities
3516,Trace mitral regurgitation Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise reveal Normal increase in overall systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction of gt
3517,All segments augment normally without inducible wall motion abnormalities
3518,SUMMARY
3519,No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia atslightly less than target heart rate which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam

3596,Record date January Matthew Wyatt M.D. Notre Dame Nursing Home New Street Hyannis NV
3597,Re William Potts MR Dear Matt I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Potts in follow up today
3598,As you know he recently had a complicated hospital course
3599,He underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD including and stenoses
3600,The first marginal branch had a ostial stenosis
3601,The right coronary artery had and stenoses respectively
3602,The PDA had a narrowing
3603,Given his very significant wish not to have bypass surgery it was decided to proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as the obtuse marginal
3604,It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel and not worth going after at this time
3605,The RCA was successfully stented but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left ventricular branch
3606,By the end of the procedure flow had been restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch but Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial infarction
3607,Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular branch the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated
3608,Mr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure
3609,The second exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging
3610,He exercised for nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol and experienced chest pain
3611,He had a maximal blood pressure of and a heart rate of
3612,MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial infarction of the basal of the inferior wall
3613,There was moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the territory of the RCA
3614,Given these findings it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts undergo bypass surgery
3615,Mr. Potts was discharged on aspirin Ticlid
3616,mg b.i.d
3617,Atorvastatin mg q.h.s
3618,Atenolol mg b.i.d
3619,Imdur mg
3620,q.d
3621,He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin
3622,Of note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress recently
3623,His yearold mother has been at Whitehead recovering William Potts MR January from a hip fracture
3624,He is having difficulty arranging the appropriate insurance to cover her medications
3625,Mr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge
3626,This occurs with increased activity and is relief with either rest andor nitroglycerin
3627,He has decreased his work level considerably and is relatively sedentary
3628,On physical exam he was well appearing and in no distress
3629,He had a blood pressure of with a heart rate of
3630,His weight was pounds
3631,Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion
3632,Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of degrees a nondisplaced PMI with a normal S and S without murmurs rubs or gallops
3633,Carotids are bilaterally without bruits
3634,His abdomen is soft nontender
3635,There is no organomegaly and no hepatojugular reflux
3636,Extremities are without edema
3637,Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of
3638,Intervals are with an axis of degrees
3639,There are flipped Twaves in III and AVF
3640,I did not have an old electrocardiogram here for comparison
3641,Therefore Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with mild exertion
3642,He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery
3643,He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work by his physicians that the Screen Actors Guild will make a good case for this
3644,There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to return to work as an actor
3645,Given Mr. Pottss current feeling I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery
3646,It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his yearold mother at home along with his wife
3647,His mother currently uses a walker and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in the house
3648,He understands this and if his chest pain should become more frequent intense or prolonged he will immediately call me
3649,If Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery I will see him in two weeks at NDNH
3650,With best regards

3812,Dear Dr. Yingling Thank you for referring your patient Imogene Adler for her problem of coronary ischemia
3813,As you know Ms. Adler is a year old woman with four years of essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest tightness associated with exertion
3814,A stress MIBI SPECT study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex distribution
3815,The details of the study include an exercise protocol for which the patient exercised for minutes and seconds for . mets with an increase in heart rate from to which is of predicted peak heart rate and increase in blood pressure from to with a rate pressure product of
3816,The test was stopped due to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain
3817,EKG demonstrated .mm of upsloping depression in II III F and VV and there were no noted arrhythmias
3818,Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her current medications include estrogen Premarin Provera and verapamil mg q.d
3819,A recent lipid panel demonstrated a total cholesterol of LDL of and an HDL of
3820,On physical examination she is comfortable well appearing woman with a weight of pounds pulse beats per minute and regular blood pressure in the left arm
3821,Jugular venous pressure was approximately cm of water
3822,Carotids demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits
3823,Chest examination was clear to auscultation
3824,Heart examination demonstrated a normal S positive S physiologically split S no murmurs or rubs
3825,Abdominal examination was RE Adler Imogene MRN
3826,Page March unremarkable
3827,Peripheral examination demonstrated no peripheral examination and bilateral peripheral pulses
3828,EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal EKG
3829,I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the probability of her having single vessel coronary artery disease as the culprit for her chest pain
3830,We reviewed the options which include medical therapy andor coronary angiography and possible angioplasty
3831,I made no solid recommendations for her but suggested that the angioplasty approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical therapy which would also be a well supported decision and I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of single vessel disease does not shorten ones life span and only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom tolerance
3832,She and her husband are going to reflect on these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the week
3833,If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography and possible angioplasty we will schedule her immediately in Cardiology
3834,I have scheduled followup in one month regardless to see her in the office
3835,Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any further assistance

3982,She has been taking quinine for this however develops palpitations whenever she takes the quinine
3983,She has not been taking this since the initial two doses
3984,I suspect that her leg cramps are probably secondary to intermittent passing fluxes
3985,I have told her to eat a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg cramps in the evening

4168,Dear Dr. Fernandes Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient Mr. Christian Mullen this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup
4169,It has been nearly months since his last visit here and in the interim time has been having discomfort involving both of his hips thighs and calves
4170,As you well know Mr. Mullen is a delightful yearold gentleman with history of hypertension hyperlipidemia coronary artery disease type diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November followed by right external right internal and right common femoral artery revascularization in February
4171,Despite the technical success of both procedures he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms
4172,When we had last evaluated him in November we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aortoiliac anatomy
4173,At the time he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss
4174,Unfortunately despite these measures he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms
4175,Symptoms are noticeable between and yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves
4176,Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately
4177,minutes
4178,He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker
4179,He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs in fact he is actually able to climb stairs to his office without limitation
4180,From the cardiac perspective Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness pressure or shortness of breath
4181,We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly years from his coronary artery bypass surgery

4212,Assessment and plan Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful yearold gentleman with history of coronary artery disease hypertension hyperlipidemia type diabetes mellitus peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip buttock thigh and claudication
4213,Mr. Mullens symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related
4214,Interestingly he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in and
4215,On examination today his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis
4216,We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies however these revealed supranormal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes
4217,Likewise we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a noninvasive imaging study i.e. CT angiogram however this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted
4218,Accordingly Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plusminus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted
4219,It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullens symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position
4220,Likewise he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree
4221,We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia
4222,He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there
4223,He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test
4224,With your permission we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plusminus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities
4225,Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness we certainly recommend blood pressure of or below and LDL cholesterol or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss
4226,We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time

4318,M.D. Loma Linda Community Hospital Caldwell Road Shady Cove NY RE Christine Olivier MR Dear Dr. Arteaga Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion regarding her current cardiac condition
4319,As her history is well known to you I will repeat it briefly for our records
4320,Mrs. Olivier is a yearold woman with a longstanding history of coronary artery disease
4321,After several catheterizations in the s which failed to document significant coronary artery disease done for evaluation of chest pain angiogram in July of showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she was managed medically
4322,However she suffered a nonQ wave myocardial infarction on February of at which time she underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary artery disease and therefore underwent a multivessel coronary bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA D and obtuse marginal branch
4323,She underwent repeat catheterization in February of at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology
4324,She underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of because of a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a proximal LAD stenosis a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch and a stenosis in the mid right coronary artery
4325,The saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site a saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch
4326,The left intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete stenoses
4327,Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of
4328,She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft to her diagonal artery
4329,She tolerated this uneventfully and was Olivier Christine MR July discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest discomfort
4330,Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild exertional dyspnea
4331,She has undergone extensive pulmonary evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which have revealed an FEV of . which is predicted and an FVC of . which is also predicted giving her a pattern consistent with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease
4332,In addition she has a history of a seizure disorder diabetes hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy

4349,Cardiac exam shows a normal S physiologically split S and a IIIVI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base no significant diastolic murmur or rub
4350,The abdomen is benign with bowel sounds well heard
4351,Extremities without appreciable edema
4352,Peripheral pulses are intact
4353,There is bipedal edema
4354,Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of
4355,PR interval of
4356,QRS
4357,QT
4358,axis degrees
4359,There is evidence of a left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V through V. Impression Mrs. Olivier is a yearold woman with significant atherosclerosis diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest exertional dyspnea and fatigue
4360,She denies any active chest discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at alleviating the chest pain syndrome
4361,The records available to me indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an exacerbation of her angina
4362,However now that she is status post her PTCA
4363,it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker reduction and therefore I suggested she decrease her atenolol to mg po q.d
4364,She will have her blood pressure checked within the next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic I will Olivier Christine MR July also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral edema and in part because she may no longer need this
4365,Otherwise I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur
4366,I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem appropriate

4445,Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain
4446,These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal
4447,Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting
4448,Patient denies jaundice
4449,Today patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank
4450,At the time of evaluation on patients had symptoms of URI and LRI
4451,She reported backgreen sputum mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandsons inhaler
4452,After consultation with Dr. Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then followup with surgeon to reschedule her surgery
4453,Patient reports that she went to University Hospital
4454,and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler
4455,Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler

4732,IMAGING STUDIES
4733,The patient has a PETCT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read
4734,To my initial evaluation there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region
4735,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
4736,Mr. Danny Nielson is a yearold gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital
4737,This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma
4738,I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son
4739,I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable
4740,This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy
4741,These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region
4742,I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found
4743,The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a lowgrade lymphoma
4744,However the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a highergrade process
4745,I feel that his leftsided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg
4746,However further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology
4747,I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.
4748,Cardiovascular I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure
4749,If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline it would be important to have Cardiology on board
4750,He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina
4751,The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week
4752,In followup Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now
4753,At that point we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed
4754,At that point we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way
4755,The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime

4760,HISTORY
4761,This is a first office visit for this yearold righthanddominant founder of Bed Bath and Beyond who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain
4762,The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain paresthesias and numbness on the right worse than left hand
4763,This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep
4764,Also bothers him during prolonged activity
4765,He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch grasp and fine motor function
4766,Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist
4767,He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release
4768,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Glucose intolerance history of previous CVA status post CABG hypertension GER
4769,MEDICATIONS
4770,Lopressor Zocor Ecotrin Effexor and Nexium
4771,ALLERGIES None
4772,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
4773,On examination today he is very pleasant well appearing in no apparent distress
4774,Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy
4775,There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and very weak opponens
4776,He has a positive Tinels positive Phalens and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist
4777,His interossei and extensors are full
4778,Sensation is intact throughout
4779,EMG studies from performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists
4780,IMPRESSION The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago
4781,At this time we feel that Larry has indeed a significant right worse than left bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
4782,Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting he has difficulty with abductor pollicis we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer
4783,We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan
4784,We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future
4785,We filled out both history and physical as well as a surgical consent form today in the office

4788,Guilford Lane Nouakchott GA RE Urania Yerger MR Dear Dr. Dillon I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first time in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in October of this year
4789,Though you know her history
4790,well I will recount it for the purposes of record keeping
4791,Ms. Yerger is presently years old
4792,Her vascular risk factors include diabetes hypertension dyslipidemia
4793,She had no prior diagnosis of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small nonST elevation myocardial infarction
4794,Coronary angiography at the Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal as well as a osteal stenosis of a large PLV
4795,Angiography also revealed a left renal artery stenosis
4796,The patient underwent subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu
4797,SVG to ramus OM RCA and LIMA to LAD
4798,Ms. Yergers postoperative course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient episode of atrial fibrillation
4799,Since her discharge she has been slowly increasing her level of activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending shopping trips
4800,Overall these symptoms have continued to improve
4801,She denies orthopnea PND or shortness of breath at rest
4802,She has had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein graft harvesting
4803,She denies palpitations presyncope TIA CVA symptoms or claudication
4804,Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative
4805,Ms. Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a possible viral exanthem
4806,Yerger Urania MR December Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency baseline creatinine vascular risk factors as delineated and prior right knee replacement
4807,Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin mg po q. day
4808,Lasix mg po q. day
4809,Glipizide mg po q. day Lisinopril mg
4810,po q. day Lopressor mg po t.i.d
4811,atorvastatin
4813,po q. day Avandia multivitamins Protonix and Nystatin cream
4814,Social History
4815,The patient lives alone but has many family members in the area
4816,She is currently staying with her daughter
4817,At baseline she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but is limited by chronic knee pain
4818,She denies alcohol or tobacco use
4819,Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age
4820,On physical exam Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today
4821,She is comfortable seated on the exam table
4822,Her skin is warm and dry
4823,She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly on her extremities
4824,Her blood pressure is her heart rate is in the s
4825,She has no jugular venous distention
4826,Her carotids are without bruits
4827,Her chest reveals decreased breath sounds at the left base
4828,There are no crackles or wheezes
4829,Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm S S and S is present and P is slightly increased
4830,There was a grade IIVI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the apex
4831,Her abdomen is soft and nontender
4832,Her extremities are free of cyanosis or clubbing
4833,Distal pulses are
4834,She has mild edema of the left lower extremity
4835,Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm beats per minute normal axis and intervals persistent deep anterior T wave inversions
4836,Overall Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after her nonST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid October
4837,Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to persistent pleural effusion
4838,We will reevaluate today with a repeat chest xray
4839,In the meantime I think that we should continue her oral diuretic regimen
4840,It is possible that her persistent rash is related to her Lasix
4841,Although not certain to be successful we have made a change to Bumex mg po q. day today in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may resolve
4842,I have made no other changes to her medical regimen
4843,We will continue aspirin beta blockade ACE inhibition and statin for secondary prevention
4844,I look forward to seeing her again in approximately eight to twelve weeks
4845,In addition she will follow up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis
4846,if she has a persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her symptoms
4847,Yerger Urania MR December It is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yergers care
4848,Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions

6168,His last visit was in December following which he had a routine stress test
6169,He had been planning to do some skiing over January and we wanted to give him clearance to do so
6170,His stress test was done on and revealed mild apical ischemia
6171,He completed METs and had no symptoms during the test
6172,Based on these findings we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities
6173,Unfortunatley he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia
6174,He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring rarely but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol
6175,The frequency of these episodes has increased to times per week
6176,He says it is not really shortness of breath but an awareness that something feels different
6177,He is able to continue his usual activities including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty
6178,He denies any chest discomfort palpitations rapid heart action dizziness or syncope

6221,He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking
6222,He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm
6223,He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mildtomoderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
6224,He is status post a posterolateral MI in and had an adenosine MIBI in January with an old inferior MI and periinfarct ischemia
6225,He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about minutes and resolves with rest
6226,He has not had any rest pain
6227,For his increasing angina he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta
6228,He then had a left brachial artery
6229,Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory
6230,There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main but the documentation of this was not clear
6231,With the complexity of his anatomy he is referred for further evaluation
6232,He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago does not drink alcohol
6233,He is married and lives in Missouri

6248,IMPRESSION Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and threevessel disease
6249,We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease
6250,We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve
6251,We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta

6351,Additional comments signed
6352,Record date Youssef Null Ludlow Medical Center Manatee Street Post IN Dear Dr. Null I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in followup of his recent admission to the ICMA
6353,While I know that you are familiar with his history please allow me to briefly review it for my records
6354,He is a lovely year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins status post mantle radiation in the early s coronary artery disease status postPCI to the LAD and RCA in and respectively and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer
6355,MIBI done at LMC showed normal EF without perfusion defects no scar or ischemia he exercised on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms
6356,He was admitted for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer ASA was stopped week prior to surgery he was not on plavix preop in PACU following resection he had a VTVF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA
6357,After extensive suction catheter use and POBA a good angiographic result was obtained no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in
6358,Remarkably echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function with basal inferoposterior HK noted
6359,His peak TnI was
6360,his peak CK was and his peak MB was He had a relatively unremarkable course postcatheterization plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed after which it was started without incident
6361,He was discharged and returns today for routine followup
6362,Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy but will be closely followed
6363,Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins he is followed at RFPC and is due for an annual visit there in the next months
6364,He has been walking outside for the past weeks since the weather improved walking about miles in around minutes
6365,He feels well and has had no problems
6366,He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion climbing hills but denies any unusual dyspnea
6367,He denies chest pain SOB at rest orthopnea stable pillow use PND edema palpitaitons or claudication
6368,He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics his BP runs in the ss with rare systolics in the s
6369,His heart rate has been in the s. His past medical history includes CAD sp IMI totally occluded RCA with good collaterals revascularized with stents to the RCA MI LAD stent inferior STEMI as above sp POBA VF arrest in setting of STEMI Hodgkins splenectomy XRT
6370,LUL squamous cell cancer sp L upper lobectomy hyperlipidemia low HDL and high LDL tried niaspan in the past without much benefit hypothyroid basal cell skin
6371,CA nephrolithiasis
6372,His medications include Lipitor mg Plavix
6373,mg ASA mg po QD
6374,Lopressor mg po BID Prilosec
6376,He has a history of intolerance dizziness with lisinopril
6377,His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension but negative for CAD
6378,He works in consulting and travels around the Midwest as part of his job
6379,He is now back at work
6380,He is married and lives in Lincoln City
6381,He and his wife have children ages they have no pets
6382,He has never smoked cigarettes
6383,He drinks glasses of wineweek and a cup of coffee qam
6384,On physical exam today he has a heart rate of and a blood pressure of
6385,He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress
6386,His JVP is flat sitting at degrees and he has no carotid bruits
6387,His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally
6388,He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S S and no murmurs rubs or gallups
6389,His abdomen is benign
6390,He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema and with PT pulses bilaterally
6391,His EKG in clinic today is NSR at with possible LAE a nonspeciifc IVCD and inferior Q waves in IIIF consistent with an inferior MI
6392,He has increased voltages consistent with LVH
6393,His recent cardiac tests include echo EF basal inferoposterior HK normal atrai no significant valvular disease cath right dominant system patent LAD stent proximal LCx proximal thrombotic RCA occlusion instent with ostial RPDA thrombotic lesion sp AngiojetPOBA with TIMI excellent angiographic result In summary this is a year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute instent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA
6394,He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this lifethreatening event
6395,Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events
6396,Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin
6397,Furthermore he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix
6398,His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen as demonstrated by his home records
6399,I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor bid to toprol bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade but otherwise would not make any changes to his regimen at this time
6400,We will check a full set of labs today but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time
6401,Given his history of Hodgkins as well as his known CAD he is clearly at risk for future events and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia
6402,Certainly if he has any concerning symptoms we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course
6403,At present however I am delighted with how well he is doing
6404,It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today
6405,I will plan to see him in followup in months time but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns

6408,He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left
6409,However one week ago he sat on the floor for hours doing electrical work flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side
6410,This lasted for hours
6411,He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis
6412,He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx
6413,He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L possibly secondary to graft kinking andor thrombosis and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM

6461,Record date MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL Stephen A.N. Xayachack M.D
6462,Will St Vicente Kadeem Sandpoint MI CK HPI Kadeem Vicente comes in today for a followup office visit
6463,The patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease for which he suffered a silent heart attack many years ago a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy as well as hypertension and GERD
6464,As it turns out the patient had been on Zantac for many many years the beneficial effects of which were unknown
6465,We had decided as of our last meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic
6466,The patient reports today that he is not symptomatic and thus we will continue to discontinue this medicine
6467,At this point the patient does not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor such as Prilosec
6468,With regard to the patients symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin since he wanted to use up all his Minipress which he tool up until nights ago
6469,Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication
6470,It is noted that his blood pressure was which is better than it was the last time he was here which the systolic range was and diastolic was
6471,The patient reports no new symptomatology other than occasional fatigue from which he will have to rest
6472,The patient has no symptoms of congestive heart failure no shortness of breath no ankle edema no JVD by observation and his laboratory results are remarkably normal given his medical complaints
6473,The patients cholesterol is with a slightly above average triglycerides
6474,Review of systems otherwise negative
6475,Physical exam is not performed at this time
6476,Blood pressure was on the right on the left temperature was . respirations and unlabored and pulse was
6477,ASSESSMENTPLAN
6478,This is a year old man with multiple medical problems coming in for followup.
6479,Hypertension the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use Hytrin now both for his hypertension as well as benign prostatic hypertrophy
6480,The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling and he said he also has urge incontinence particularly while standing
6481,The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin which hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy that this urge incontinency will also be helped
6482,If the patients symptoms continue beyond this he will be referred to Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
6483,BPH please see above
6484,The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.
6485,coronary artery disease the patients cholesterol is with a slightly above average triglycerides which is more than acceptable for this gentleman
6486,I do not have an HDL in which to judge his ratio
6487,but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high s MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL
6488,Stephen A.N. Xayachack M.D. Will St Vicente Kadeem Sandpoint MI CK PAGE or low s
6489,Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without therapy
6490,I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in about months and if there is any derangement in his profile he will be put on an antilipid drug.
6491,GI at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned and what I will attempt to do is to keep him off his H blockers at this point
6492,Should his symptoms return the patient most likely will be placed on Prilosec
6493,I will seen him in one month for followup primarily for evaluation of his use of Hytrin

7122,Hospital course cb GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum sp exlap gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection splenectomy and primary anastamosis with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins
7123,He also had VREklebsiella LUQ abscess sp IR drainage
7124,He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin
7125,So he was switched to vancoambisomelinezolidmeropenemamikacin for LUQ abscess
7126,After weeks of highdose ambisome he was taken back to OR on for reexploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophagealjejunostomy site that surgeons scooped out as much as they could but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions
7127,Given the inability to completely enbloc resect Mr. Ethridges GI mucor despite a longtrial of Ambisome he was started on an investigational drug posaconazole provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis
7128,This has had success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials

7158,This is a regularly scheduled visit for this Eva Ruledge a year old woman with a history of hypertension and borderline obesity
7159,She was last here in February with no complaints but did have an elevated creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further evaluation
7160,The patient did not however present to the Internal Medicine as planned
7161,She states that she has been too busy
7162,Her only complaint today is of some right leg pain which she says is chronic and which is relieved to some extent by acetaminophen
7163,Eva continues to take Procardia XL mg
7164,PO q.day
7165,A noted in her ambulatory record the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug however Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than on an almost p.r.n
7166,basis
7167,Review of systems is essentially normal
7168,Specifically she denies any headaches any chest pain any shortness of breath
7169,She also denies any symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract
7170,She has no history of dysuria of frequent urinary tract infection or of hematuria
7171,Physical Examination

7177,There are no murmurs or rubs
7178,Abdomen is slightly obese nontender and with normal bowel sounds
7179,No masses are appreciated
7180,Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion
7181,Indeed exam of her legs is entirely unremarkable
7182,Laboratory Will include a repeat creatinine a urinalysis and urine sediment and a urine creatinine
7183,Assessment and Plan
7184,Hypertension Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure on her Procardia
7185,I have asked her to stop taking Procardia which she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol beginning at mg
7186,PO q.day
7187,I will see her in a few days in order to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug and also to check her blood pressure once again.
7188,Right leg pain
7189,This would appear to be chronic and may well be related to her work which requires her to scuttle throughout the hospital at fairly high speed She is a Pulping Control Operator
7190,I have asked her to continue taking Tylenol and we will reevaluate her need for more powerful agents such as nonsteroidals if the need arises
7191,PROMPTCARE INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES Rutledge Eva Page
7192,Elevated creatinine
7193,Unfortunately Eva has not kept her Renal appointment
7194,In order to prevent this from recurring a third time I have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong
7195,She is to see him on the th of this month at p.m
7196,and I have also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him
7197,Hopefully he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney function.

7233,Record date January Freeman Faust M.D. Evergreen Court Hospital Factory Street Haleyville MN RE Jacob Rodriquez M.D. MR Dear Dr. Faust Thank you for kindly referring your patient Jacob Rodriquez to the Internal Medicine for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension
7234,Although Im sure you are familiar with his history I will review it now for our records
7235,Dr. Rodriquez is a yearold retired Electrician at Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent health until the past year
7236,He denies any prior history of hypertension coronary artery disease chest pains significant childhood illnesses or malignancy
7237,He describes his usual baseline health as excellent
7238,He is a religious walker walking multiple times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast
7239,Dr. Rodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia
7240,This was treated with Metformin
7241,Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added apparently for hypertension although the patient does not believe he has been diagnosed with hypertension
7242,He subsequently developed diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was subsequently reduced in dose
7243,In June of the past year the patient was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his Hydrochlorothiazide
7244,At that time he also was found to have lower extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the Hydrochlorothiazide
7245,The patient states in September of he traveled to trinidad and tobago
7246,While in trinidad and tobago he had a marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he found it difficult to ambulate
7247,He denied any difficulty with chest pains or shortness of breath
7248,He had no hemoptysis and no focal unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility during the trip
7249,He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema significantly
7250,However he subsequently developed diarrhea to this medication and it was stopped

7339,He will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an arterial blood gas drawn
7340,If this evaluation should be unrevealing he may require more invasive diagnostics
7341,Ive already consulted formally with Dr. Eddie Roy the physician with most experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our workup is nondiagnostic
7342,Dr. Faust thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation

7735,ASSESSMENT
7736,Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined
7737,We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography
7738,The degree of his mitral disease is not clear
7739,He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially
7740,However the episodicity is significant.
7741,Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output and is cold and wet pattern
7742,His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change
7743,However the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected
7744,It is also possible that this is related to angina.
7745,Other related risks
7746,He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before
7747,It is possible that he has had other emboli possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function
7748,There are no obvious contraindications to transplant
7749,At this time we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation
7750,Our plan is to hold his betablockers and ACE inhibitors for now and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion
7751,We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state

7962,She subsequently underwent a mediastinoscopy in April of this year for bulky adenopathy which the pathology was also consistent with sarcoidosis
7963,She present for evaluation of abdominal pain that has been present for months but became unbearable prompting a visit to the emergency room
7964,Mrs. Haynes reports that over the past few months she has been experiencing weight loss early satiety night sweats and fatigue
7965,He abdominal pain is described as a sharp to achy pain that started in her right side progressed to her epigastric and suprapubic are and then her left side
7966,Currently it is diffuse associated with nausea and vomiting

8019,Impression Mrs. Haynes is a pleasant yo female with biopsy demonstrating noncaesating granululoma in a left eye nodule and mediastinal lymph nodes
8020,Cx data was not obtained
8021,However hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors
8022,Clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis
8023,At this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids
8024,At this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and Dr. Villalpando
8025,Recommendations Would consider Cardiac MRI given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment
8026,Would recommend checking PPD Would recommend starting prednisone mg po qday
8027,Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow
8028,There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr. Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs. Haynes
8029,Would also recommend Bactrim prophylaxis while she is on greater than mg Po prednisone

8064,Record date POLK GENERAL HOSPITAL Internal Medicine Lisbon Lane Holden Matias Palacios NE Patient is a yearold man who comes in for follow up on his newly diagnosed type II diabetes
8065,He has been very compliant with his medication regimen which consists of metformin mg PO t.i.d. and NPH insulin subQ q.AM
8066,He has had episodes of sweating but he did not check his blood sugar at the time
8067,He has not had any frank palpitations or lightheadedness
8068,He did have episode where he had the sensation of several extra heart beats
8069,This was not accompanied by other symptoms including no chest pain
8070,He has never had a fingerstick blood glucose below the mid s. I am looking through his log and see that his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between and before dinner they have been between
8071,He has already met several times with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his therapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a diabetic diet
8072,On physical exam he is in no distress his weight is his blood pressure is in the right arm sitting
8073,IMPRESSION AND PLAN
8074,He still has high sugars
8075,I will increase his insulin regimen
8076,He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his new regimen will be NPH insulin units before breakfast and units before bedtime
8077,And he continues to take metformin
8078,mg PO t.i.d
8079,and I have given him a prescription for this refills as well as syringes and needles refills
8080,He is to follow up with me in several months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns
8081,I have advised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining his diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any symptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading at that time as well

8342,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
8343,This yearold ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA
8344,The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed
8345,In February she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning
8346,There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg
8347,This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion she fell getting out of bed
8348,The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated
8349,She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected she feels that the event has not reoccured
8350,The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well
8351,She was seen by Neurology on after she was admitted
8352,The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report
8353,Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe
8354,Also in the record is noted that at the time of the second event her glucose was very low at around and symptoms resolved after treatment with D. There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event
8355,On examination at the time of admission there were no clear findings
8356,MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes
8357,The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage
8358,MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes
8359,Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt
8360,Currently the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup
8361,It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was
8362,Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA
8363,Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor
8364,There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage
8365,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough
8366,The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills
8367,There are no medication allergies reported

8376,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Blood pressure is pulse and regular respirations
8377,The patient is overweight
8378,Height is foot inches
8379,Weight is pounds
8380,Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants though without clear spasm
8381,Poor neck posture is noted
8382,Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels
8383,Cardiovascular testing carotids are without bruits
8384,Temporal arteries are normal
8385,Musculoskeletal testing gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years
8386,Romberg is negative
8387,Tandem gait is normal
8388,The patient does move slowly in general this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia
8389,There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left
8390,This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic
8391,There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted
8392,NEUROLOGICAL TESTING Mental status is essentially normal to orientation memory attention language and fund of information
8393,Cranial nerve testing pupils are mm and briskly reactive
8394,Extraocular movements are full
8395,Visual fields are intact
8396,There is no facial sensory loss but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological
8397,Visual fields are intact
8398,Hearing is intact
8399,Oropharynx is normal
8400,Palate elevates well
8401,Tongue is midline
8402,Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact
8403,Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and in the upper extremities
8404,There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing
8405,Coordination testing today seemed intact
8406,Prior neurologic evaluation from is reviewed
8407,Homocystine level was elevated at normal zero to ten
8408,Recommended treatment included folate pyridoxine and B. IMPRESSION
8409,Transient neurologic symptoms question etiology
8410,Comment
8411,I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress
8412,I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant
8413,Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature
8414,In this regard the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant
8415,It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage
8416,PLAN
8417,Although she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent
8418,She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure
8419,We therefore suggested Plavix mg daily
8420,We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox
8421,It probably does not matter which medication she chooses however she should be on one or the other and not both
8422,For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation we have added simply multivitamins two daily
8423,I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms
8424,She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly
8425,We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months

8695,She has been to the emergency room multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin
8696,She has been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and dicloxacillin
8697,She is planning to have her disease surgically managed in the next few months
8698,She most recently presented to the emergency room on January with swelling and drainage of her hydradenitis in her groin
8699,She was given a prescription of Keflex
8700,Shortly after taking the first tablet she developed itching in the hands face and legs and as well as hives
8701,She denied any shortness of breath difficulty breathing or loss of consciousness
8702,She called the emergency room and was instructed to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic reaction

8720,Despite the cross allergy of dicloxacillin compared to Keflex I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for now
8721,If this does not work I think one should consider clindamycin for treatment
8722,I will go ahead and give her days worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D. if she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine
8723,I also gave her tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her prescription of Glucotrol XL

9174,Record date July Harry R. Lynn M.D. Doraville County Health Center Cider Street Platteville HI RE Isabelle Y. Quick ATCH Dear Harry and Yair
9175,My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance
9176,As you know she is just years of age
9177,Her cardiovascular risk factors include type diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide hypertension hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year
9178,She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband
9179,She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease
9180,She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations
9181,On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fempop bypass graft
9182,This reconstruction is functioning well as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side
9183,In April of she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fempop bypass graft to the aboveknee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins
9184,There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent
9185,She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit
9186,By last spring i.e. a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication
9187,She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks
9188,Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss
9189,Recently resting ABIs were recorded at . on the right
9190,and
9191,on the left
9192,Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion length thereof she did not bring the films themselves and a patent albeit small reconstituted aboveknee popliteal artery with decent runoff
9193,Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations
9194,She has sought an opinion here in this regard
9195,She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy
9196,On physical examination blood pressure was
9197,Pulse was and regular
9198,Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits
9199,She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fempop bypass graft in situ is palpable as is the left popliteal pulse
9200,There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse
9201,She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown
9202,This is of course a very unhappy situation
9203,Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good
9204,However I am not absolutely ruling this out
9205,I would suggest the following
9206,Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor aspirin and Plavix
9207,Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit
9208,She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me
9209,If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered
9210,I will get back to you after review of the films themselves
9211,My thanks once again
9212,With every best wish

9261,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
9262,This is a yearold righthanded woman with a history of hypertension diabetes and hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the Neurology Service on with rightarm weakness and difficulty speaking
9263,She presented to the Emergency Room
9264,hours after last seeming normal
9265,Her initial NI stroke scale was
9266,She was admitted to the Neurology Service for a stroke workup
9267,Her imaging studies showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata head of the caudate basal ganglia and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA in addition to a left ICA occlusion
9268,She was taken to angiogram for interventional neuroradiology
9269,She had an angiogram
9270,Radiology felt they were unable to access the cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and hypertensive therapy
9271,She remained stable anticoagulated on heparin
9272,During the hospital stay she spontaneously converted to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation which was felt to be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to remain anticoagulated
9273,She was discharged to rehab and subsequently went home from rehab on
9274,At home she had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been feeling O.K. VNA sees her once a week
9275,At rehab for unclear reasons her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic this was done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is unaware of any such problems
9276,She continues to get PT and occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory remains poor
9277,According to the family member and her daughter who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today she continues to have rightsided weakness although significantly improved and decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able to communicate well with her
9278,Since her discharge she has not had any new episodes of numbness weakness headaches or visual changes

9315,Visual fields are full to confrontation
9316,She has a right facial droop
9317,Facial sensation is intact
9318,Hearing is normal
9319,Motor exam There is increased muscle tone on the right arm and leg
9320,She has strength on the left is normal
9321,On the right her strength is at least in all muscle groups on the left on the neck except for about in the distal arm
9322,She reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm
9323,There is no ataxia on the left
9324,Gait is slow walks with a cane and so conducts the right leg
9325,Her reflexes are brisker on the right at about and she has a right plantar extensor response
9326,IMAGING DATA Initial head CT on did not show any acute stroke or hemorrhage
9327,On the CT there was a question of a left MI cutoff
9328,CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA stenosis with minimal distal interflow
9329,MRI of the brain showed a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata head of the caudate basal ganglia
9330,She has had mild to moderate chronic small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI
9331,Echo showed a normal EF of without any clot no PFO
9332,IMPRESSION This is a yearold woman with significant vascular risk factors including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory infarct
9333,On exam she has residual aphasia involving both comprehension and fluency and a moderate right hemiparesis
9334,It is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during her hospital stay
9335,I think that she would benefit from anticoagulation therapy
9336,I have asked her to get a follow up PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are any contraindications to anticoagulation
9337,If there are no such contraindications she should restart on warfarin
9338,In addition her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask her to increase her Captopril to
9339,mg t.i.d
9340,and to maintain a blood pressure diary
9341,RECOMMENDATIONS
9342,Continue antihypertensive and increase Captopril to
9343,mg t.i.d.
9344,Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.

9470,Mr. Aguilar is a yo man with ho CF with mild pulmonary disease who presented to an OSH on with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias followed by a loss of left visual field diplopia and left sided weakness
9471,The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness
9472,The patient was evaluated at the OSH with noncontrast head CT and LP which were significant only for elevated CSF protein
9473,Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam
9474,Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis otherwise neurologic exam nonfocal
9475,Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles
9476,DDX for above includes ischemic process though symptoms appear to be multifocal vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process
9477,Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms or meningeal process
9478,We plan to obtain CNS MRI neuro consult
9479,Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic workup
