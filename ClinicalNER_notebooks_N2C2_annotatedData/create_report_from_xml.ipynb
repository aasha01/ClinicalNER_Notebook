She has been in Rhode Island for \\nsix months.  Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.  She \\ndoes not have any palpitations.  She does not note that this is \\nassociated with exertion.  She does have diaphoresis associated with it.  \\nShe does not have any shortness of breath.  This heaviness has been in \\nher chest on and off for the last six weeks.  She is quite concerned.\\n\\nShe has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.  She also has \\nhyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.  Her health \\nmaintenance has been in order.  She has just had a hysterectomy.  She \\nneeds to have a follow-up mammogram done.  However, today I am most \\nconcerned about her chest heaviness.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is \\n20 and pulse is 68.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  \\nChest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is \\nregularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and \\nnontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of \\ncyanosis, clubbing and edema.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise \\nwithin normal limits.  TSH is 2.0.  LFTs are pending at this time.  We \\nsent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with \\nnonspecific ST-T wave changes.  We also sent her for an exercise \\ntolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a \\nmaximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 \\nseconds.  She had no evidence of ischemia.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\\n1.\\tChest heaviness.  I am not sure what is causing this.  She may have a \\nprimary pulmonary problem.  She will be following up with us in one \\nweek.  It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal \\nexercise tolerance test.\\n2.\\tHypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time.

I understand that he is referred here for evaluation of polyneuropathy.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMr. Tuttle is a 63-year-old right-handed diabetic man who has developed numbness of his lower extremities since 2125.  The numbness started in his toes and gradually spread proximally up to the level of the knees.  In 2135, the numbness started to affect his hands.  In 2139, the patient noted atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous muscles of both hands, left worse than right.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe patient denies any pain in his legs or feet.  He has a five year history of localized low back pain and neck pain radiating to his left upper extremity all the way down to his hands.  In 2125, the patient fell down a ladder from a height of about 30 feet.  According to the patient, he herniated a cervical disk, but surgery was not indicated.  He remembers having pain in his left elbow and neck after the fall.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe patient developed impotence and constipation in 2130.  In 2139, he started to have symptoms of orthostatic hypotension which he described as feeling light-headed, darkening of vision upon standing.  The patient also noted gait imbalance in 2139 prior to his retirement in 2141.  \\n\\n \\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes since 2123, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, constipation, impotence, macular degeneration of the eyes, retinopathy, s/p laser treatments, history of neck pain and low back pain as mentioned above, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, skin problems using a number of steroid creams, penile implant in 2130.  \\n\\n \\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, Diltiazem, Zestril, Mevacor, steroid creams, Colace, metoclopramide, Naprosyn, insulin.   \\n\\n\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  \\n\\n \\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married he has two daughters, 30 and 40 years of age.  He used to work as a Legal Secretary until he retired in December of 2141.  The patient quit smoking in 2107.  He denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse.  \\n\\n \\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of unclear cause at the age of 45.  His father was diabetic and had heart problems.  Mother died in her 30's.  The patient does not know the cause of death.  The patient had one brother who died in his 50's from diabetic complications.  He had two sister who died of diabetic complications.  Of his two living sisters, one of them is also a diabetic.  The patient's daughters are not diabetic.  There is no known family history of neuromuscular disorders.  \\n\\n \\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Range of motion of the neck is limited.  Head turning 45 degrees to either side.  Limited neck extension.  Negative straight-leg raising.  Negative spine tenderness.  Regular cardiac rhythm, no heart murmur.  Negative carotid bruits.  In the supine position, blood pressure 105/50, heart rate 60 and regular.  Upon standing, blood pressure dropped to 60/40, heart rate remained 60.  The patient was asymptomatic.   \\n\\n\\n\\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Mental status:  Alert, coherent and appropriate.  The patient knows the name of his physician, Dr. Duvall, Dr. Villagomez, and Dr. Goldberg at Pioneer Home.  \\n\\n \\n\\nCranial nerves:  Visual fields full.  Visual acuity with reading glasses 20/30 on the right, 20/20 -1 on the left.  Extraocular movements full.  No nystagmus.  Pupils sluggishly reactive to light.  Optic discs flat bilaterally.  No facial asymmetry.  The tongue and soft palate move symmetrically.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMotor examination:  Atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous and ADM, worse on the left hand.  No atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis.  Negative arm drift.  Motor strength testing 5/5 in all muscles of both upper extremities except for 4/5 weakness of the first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi bilaterally.  No weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis on either hand.  Motor strength testing of the lower extremities 5/5 except for mild weakness of toe extensors 4+/5 bilaterally.  The patient was able to walk on his toes and heels while holding onto the examiner.  Deep tendon reflexes 2+ bilaterally at the biceps, triceps, and knees.  Absent ankle jerks bilaterally.  Toes downgoing.  No spasticity of the lower extremities.\\n\\n   \\n\\nSensory examination:  Significant for absent pin prick sensation in both feet up to the level of the knees.  Pin prick sensation is diminished in the dorsal aspect of all fingers and the palmar aspect of both hands.  Vibratory sensation absent in the toes, intact at the ankles and knees bilaterally.  Intact vibratory sensation in the upper extremities.  Romberg test significant for body swaying, but the patient did not fall.  Tandem gait was poor, but improved when holding the examiner.  No limb ataxia.   \\n\\n\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Review of previous laboratory tests of May, 2145, BUN 36, creatinine 1.7, glucose 310.  December, 2144, TSH normal.  October, 2143, B12 normal.  Negative RPR.  The patient said he was tested negative for HIV in 2142, and 2143.  MRI of the brain in 2142 and 2143 revealed bilateral white matter changes in the cerebral hemisphere without any intracranial mass lesion.   \\n\\n\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, we have a 63-year-old diabetic man who appears to have significant sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic involvement.  He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAs we discussed on the phone, his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this.  He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.  The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.  The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125.  He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  \\n\\n \\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nStanly Lang, M.D.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ncc: Dr. T.

It is worse with lifting.  The pain is in her deltoid muscle and radiates a little bit across her upper back.  It is worse if she actually lies on her shoulder at night.  There is no history of trauma, no neck pain, no upper extremity numbness or weakness except for occasional left thumb numbness.  The thumb numbness resolves if she shakes her hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe is also having bilateral knee pain when she walks.  There is no swelling or effusion or heat in her knees.  She had been on Vioxx for her spinal stenosis but stopped it because it was not helping her spinal stenosis pain.  Instead for her shoulder pain she has been taking Advil 200 mg 2 and up to 6 per day. She takes the Advil with food or milk and is not having any GI upset from it.  \\n\\n\\n\\nShe is having a lot of stresses with her husband, whom she feels may have some early memory problems.  His mini-mental status on his last exam was a 30/40.  However, he makes, according to her, arbitrary decisions, does not complete projects he starts, and not as task-oriented as he used to be.  He does not complete tasks or shopping errands that she would like him to do.  We discussed that he should make a follow-up appointment to see me to repeat his mini-mental status exam, but that some of these problems are not likely to be easily resolvable, and that she might benefit from finding ways to manage her anxiety and stress level.  She does get very anxious and upset at times.  She had been considering taking Ativan p.r.n. when she gets very upset and frustrated.  She is also having stressors with her grandson, who lives next door and has a problem with substance abuse and questionable money issues.  \\n\\n\\n\\nShe denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or edema.  She is on her diabetes medication.  She likes going to work because that gets her out of the house.\\n\\n\\n\\nON EXAMINATION:  She is a pleasant, animated woman in no acute distress.  Her blood pressure initially was 160/80.  After discussing her situation with her husband, her blood pressure was 180/85.  Neck supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear without rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm and normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  She has no peripheral edema.\\n\\n \\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \\n\\n\\n\\n(1)\\tHypertension, poor control.  Will increase her Zestril to 40 mg p.o. q.d.  Her daughter, Iyanna Field who is a registered nurse, will continue to monitor her blood pressure.  \\n\\n(2)\\tRight shoulder pain.  On exam she has good range of motion of her shoulder and her muscle strength and reflexes are intact.  She can continue the Advil p.r.n. but should take it with antacids or something to protect her stomach.  \\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\tAdult-onset diabetes.  We will check her Hemoglobin A1c.  \\n\\n\\n\\nShe will follow up for her complete physical in May.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIda Xayachack, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\nIX/delarosa/austin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I have not seen him since November. \\nAbout three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because\\nhe was gaining weight.  He does feel that his shoulders are\\ndefinitely improved.  It is unclear what he is actually taking, but\\nI think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the\\nmedication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension\\nand 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.  He is concerned because of the\\nrelatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the\\nright.  When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he\\nis going to pass out although this has not actually happened.  This\\nonly occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.  He has\\nno visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other\\ncranial complaints.  \\n \\nOn examination today, BP 120/80.  He has no bruits over the\\ncarotid.  He has no tenderness in this region either.  He has good\\nperipheral pulses at the arms.  His joint examination is much\\nimproved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint\\nsynovitis.  \\n \\nClinical Impression:\\n \\n#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to\\nHydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.  He has stopped the\\nPrednisone, and I would not restart it yet.  \\n \\n#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid\\ndisease.  Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.

He was golfing at the time, and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes. The weakness involved the face, arm and leg on the left side only. He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220/140 (per his report). A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal. He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA. He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine. They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined. No further stroke/TIA workup was performed.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup. His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal. He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability.

Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has\\nundergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps. \\nThree have been removed and he then had a GI bleed.  This has been\\nreevaluated and he has been stable.  The fourth polyp will need to\\nbe removed at a later time.  At this point, his aspirin has been\\ndiscontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also\\ndiscontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests. \\nHis current medications therefore include Lasix 40 mg per day,\\nMetoprolol 25 mg qd, Nifedipine XL 30 mg qd.  He is aware of a\\nbelching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no\\nexertional or other related symptoms.  He is reasonably active but\\nsomewhat limited by his claudication.\\n \\nOn exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 130/70,\\na heart rate of 65 and regular.  Head and neck were unremarkable. \\nChest is clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension\\nat 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a\\nphysiologic split.  There is an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection\\nmurmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was\\nunremarkable.

Rule out \\nosteoporosis.  \\n \\nHPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, \\ndiagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.  At \\nthe time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.  \\nWhether this was a Hodgkin\\'s or non-Hodgki\\'s lymphoma is unclear to us, \\nbut he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for \\napproximately 26 weeks.  At that point, he was believed to be in \\nremission and stayed in remission since then.  \\n \\nIn 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he \\npresented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.  Subsequently he \\nwas treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since \\nthat time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and \\nsix of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.  \\nHe currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the \\n100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus \\nPaz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.  The patient\\'s \\ncomplications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.  There is \\nno peripheral neuropathy.  There is no autonomic neuropathy.  No retinal \\ndisease.  However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline \\ncreatinine currently of 2.4.  \\n \\nRecently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial \\nsymptoms in the early 80s.  By June of 2082, the patient had fairly \\nsevere symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July \\n2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial \\ninfarctions.  In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac \\ntransplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.  Since \\nthat time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection \\nwith relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum \\ndegree of symptoms.  \\n \\nThe patient\\'s current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a \\nday; prednisone 8 mg. a day.  Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. \\ntwice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 \\nmg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.  \\n \\nReview of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that \\nwas from a trauma some years ago.  Other past medical history includes \\nhistory of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.  \\n \\nRACHAEL G.

His father and mother have had \\ndiabetes mellitus, his father dying of heart disease.  There is a \\n19-year-old daughter who has a history of migraines.  There is no \\nhistory of thyroid disease in the family.\\n \\nSocial History:  He currently works at Belkin and has a desk job \\nthere.  He quit smoking and drinking 15-20 years ago.  He has been \\nmarried for over 20 years.  His review of symptoms revealed the absence \\nof GI symptoms.  There were no orthostatic symptoms, no angina.  Normal \\nsexual function.  He denied any skin problems or rashes.  He denied \\nnumbness and tingling in his feet, etc.  There is a history of \\nhypertension.  \\n \\nOther review of systems:  His height has been stable at 6\\'2\" tall.  \\n \\nPhysical Examination:  Blood pressure 130/93.  Heart rate 96.   The \\npatient is a well-appearing gentleman, somewhat obese.  His height is \\n6\\'2\".  Weight 294 lbs. which is apparently steadily been increasing.  He \\nhas a mild Cushingoid appearance with a little bit of posterior cervical \\nand supraclavicular fat.  Retina appeared without lesions.  Normal \\nextra-ocular movements.  His oral mucosa was moist without evidence of \\nthrush.  Neck exam:  He had a supple neck with no carotid bruits.  \\nNormal thyroid.   His chest exam revealed clear lung fields with normal \\nexcretion.  There was no bony tenderness or abnormalities on his back.  \\nHis cardiac exam:  He had a soft, S1, S2.  Cardiac exam otherwise \\nunremarkable.  His abdomen was soft.  He had some evidence of insulin \\ninjections, but no significant hypertrophy.  He injects both in his \\nabdomen and rotates with his arms.  His extremities revealed minimal \\nstasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric.  No edema.  \\nNeurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic.  He had normal to slightly \\ndecreased vibratory sensation in his big toes.  \\n \\nLaboratory Exam:  Most recent laboratories that I could find were \\nFebruary 09, 2084.  Sodium 141.  K 5.1; chloride 105.  Bicarb 20.  BUN \\n39.  Creatinine 3.4; glucose 136.  His CK was 219.  Calcium 9.7.  \\nAlbumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0.  Alkaline phosphatase was 90.  Uric acid \\n5.1; magnesium 1.9.  TSH was 1.6.  Cholesterol 242.  Triglycerides 226.  \\nHis cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273.  His CBC \\nrevealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a \\nnormal differential.  \\n \\nAssessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of \\nmultiple medical problems.

The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it \\nis about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his \\nchemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.  \\nThe patient\\'s history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no \\nheight loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might \\nbe somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant \\npatients.  However, getting a bone density study in the patient like \\nthis makes sense.  We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on \\nhis follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling \\nreasons.  We will also check vitamin D levels given patient\\'s history of \\nrenal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to \\ndo for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated \\nto be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy \\nvegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.  We would be a little \\nreticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, \\nwithout more information about this patient.  The patient\\'s diabetes \\nseems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under \\nfairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we \\ndon\\'t have access to hemoglobin A1C.  Given the fact that it sounds like \\nhe has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at \\nthe current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone \\nsituation.

As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.  He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, \\n\\nmainly related to sports injuries.\\n\\n \\n\\nHe has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.  It got so \\n\\nbad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that. \\n\\n \\n\\nIt has slowly got better since then.  \\n\\n \\n\\nAt present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with \\n\\nactivity but he also has rest and night pain.  He has a restricted walking \\n\\ndistance.\\n\\n \\n\\nWith regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and \\n\\nrequires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.  He has \\n\\nnoticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWith regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of \\n\\nTylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to \\n\\nhave a colonoscopy in the near future.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHe has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.\\n\\n \\n\\nOn examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than \\n\\nthe left.  He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHe has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of \\n\\narthritis.  He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 \\n\\ndegrees.  His varus deformity is not fully correctable.  He has grade 5 \\n\\nquadriceps power.  \\n\\n \\n\\nX-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete \\n\\nobliteration of joint space on the right side.  \\n\\n \\n\\nI note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment \\n\\narthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWe have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial \\n\\nosteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement. \\n\\n \\n\\nAt present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe \\n\\nenough to warrant operative intervention.  We would certainly reconsider \\n\\nshould he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, \\n\\ninstilling some corticosteroids.  We have advised him that this will only \\n\\nprovide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin \\n\\nsome walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will \\n\\nreassess him.  Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly \\n\\nring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the \\n\\nknee and instill some corticosteroid.  \\n\\n \\n\\nWith kind regards.  \\n\\n \\n\\nYours sincerely, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\nOliver M.

He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis. He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication. His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper. \\n\\nHe felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.  On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.  This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted. The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths.

His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.  His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem List and Plan:\\n\\nSOB/Chest tightness:\\n\\n\\t--continue to cycle enzymes for R/O\\n\\n-CXR AP and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema\\n\\n\\t-TTE\\n\\n\\t-diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV\\n\\n\\t-Hydralazine 10mg QID & Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID \\n\\n\\t-d/c Lisinopril\\n\\n-continue O2 at 2L, monitor O2 sat\\n\\n\\t-monitor ins and outs, daily weights\\n\\n\\t-obtain lipid panel to assess CAD risk factors and need for statin\\n\\nRenal failure: acute over chronic, baseline nephropathy due to DM and HTN, history of \\n\\n+protein in urine, urine sediment spun, no signs of active sediment \\n\\n-urinary electrolytes to measure FENa\\n\\n-d/c Lisinopril\\n\\n-dose Neurontin according to renal function\\n\\n-consider ruling out renal artery stenosis\\n\\n-obtain urinary eosinophils to evaluate for interstitial nephritis\\n\\nHypertension: hypertensive emergency considered, but determined to be unlikely due to \\n\\nchronity of elevated SBP at similar values, under treatment\\n\\n\\t-continue Toprol XL 100mg QD, Norvasc 5mg BID\\n\\n-add Hydralazine 10mg QID, Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID\\n\\n-monitor BP and signs and symptoms of target organ damage closely\\n\\nOpioid withdrawal/pain management:\\n\\n\\t-Morphine PRN\\n\\n\\t-consult pain service\\n\\nDM:\\n\\n\\t-sliding scale insulin\\n\\n\\t-obtain Insulin and C peptide levels because unclear if currently taking Insulin\\n\\nProphylaxis:\\n\\n\\t-20mg Nexium PO QD\\n\\n\\t-Heparin 5000 units SC BID\\n\\n                                        \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t___________________________\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t           Udo O.

She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, fever, chills.   \\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM \\nMs. Yount looks well.  Blood pressure is 148/90.  Body weight is 188.  Repeat blood pressure is 170/80.  On examination of head and neck - no absolutely.  Thyroid is soft, nontender, no nodules.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart - regular rate and rhythm, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, bowel sounds present.  Extremities - trace edema.  \\n \\nLABORATORY \\nPending.  \\n \\nIMPRESSION \\nMs. Yount has diabetes and hypertension with a mildly elevated creatinine.  Her urine shows presence of protein, which suggests diabetic nephropathy.  Upon review of her medications, she is on a very good medication control, and  her blood pressure has been well controlled.  However, today the blood pressure is running higher.  I will see her in about two to three months.  If her blood pressure continues to be high, we should try to increase her dose of ARB.  I also explained to Ms. Yount the importance of taking aspirin and that she should continue her daily aspirin.   \\n \\n_______________________________ \\nBrandon Vicente, M.D.  \\n \\nDD:03/08/2088 \\nDT:03/10/2088 \\nJM:99704     :137 \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

She di dnot take tegretol, but rather increased her amytriptiline and added some darvocet acutely, now off these meds.  Her R eye \"tears a lot\", at no particular time (ie, not necessarily when she\\'s masticating), and occasionally it burns....but she has not developed conjunctivitis or ocular redness or discharge.  She has difficulty chewing opn the R side of her mouth, and finds she\"pockets\" food in her R cheek; she manages by chewing on L, and swallowing frequently, especially taking extra liquids.\\n\\nThe pain has receded-  she now only gets \"a twinge\" now and then.\\n\\n\\n\\nHusband has noticed she\\'s not hearing quite as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer current meds include amitryptiline 25 hs, mevacor 20, procardia 30 bid, furosemide 40x3, isosorbide 20 qd allopurinol 300 qd.  She\\'s releived to learn the results of her recent blood work, including BUN 65 Creat 3.4, Hct 29.8\\n\\n\\n\\nOn exam, she has gained weight since I last saw her; she comes in ok0on wheelchair, but is able to take a few steps with her straight cane, and climb onto the examining tabloe with only contact guard. Dense catarcts; fundi not visualized; EOMS full without ptosis or nystagmus. Cornelas are brisk pilaterally, but she has decreased sensationon the R lower facial segments (V1, V2); excellent masseter and temporalis strength. R lower facial weakness, with less evident weakness of orbicularis oculi; he manages to close the eyelid almost completely; + Bell\\'s phenomenon.  She hears finger rub at 90 cm on R, 70 cm on L; Weber lateralizes to the R, but Rinne\\' positive bilatyerally (ie, AC>BC AU). Tongue midline.  Modulates voice well.

In terms of her cardiac history, she was well\\n\\nuntil four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath\\n\\nand was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart\\n\\nfailure.  At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which\\n\\nrevealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to\\n\\nshortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a\\n\\ndilated left ventricle.  In addition, she had an echo in June of\\n\\n2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral\\n\\nregurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. \\n\\nShe has never been hospitalized since that time for her\\n\\ncongestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good\\n\\nresult. She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or\\n\\nclaudication.  She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.\\n\\nIn fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her\\n\\nrecollection.  She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house\\n\\nand can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs. She is\\n\\nable to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty\\n\\nfrom chest \\n\\n \\n\\nJorgenson, Vivian Lea\\n\\nMR #471-90-84-7               -2-            August 21, 2071\\n\\n \\n\\npains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops\\n\\nsecondary to fatigue.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHer past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,\\n\\nCHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule. She has never had\\n\\nsurgery. Her family history is significant for a mother who died\\n\\nof myocardial infarction at the age of 55. \\n\\n \\n\\nHer social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for\\n\\n40 years and quit four years ago. She denies alcohol, intravenous\\n\\ndrugs or cocaine use.  She lives with her husband and briefly\\n\\nworked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.  She\\n\\nhas no known drug allergies. \\n\\n \\n\\nHer current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril\\n\\n50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po\\n\\nQD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily\\n\\nand Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.  \\n\\n \\n\\nOn physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in\\n\\nher left arm and 165/70 in her right. Her heart rate was 104 when\\n\\nI saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today. Her JVP was 7\\n\\ncentimeters. Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid\\n\\nbruits. Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles. Her\\n\\nheart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with\\n\\noccasional ectopic beats. She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6\\n\\nsystolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without\\n\\nradiation. Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds. Her\\n\\nextremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHer EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.  She has a\\n\\ndiffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin\\n\\neffects.  She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old\\n\\nanterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIn summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,\\n\\nhyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease\\n\\nwith congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,\\n\\nlikely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial\\n\\ninfarction, although she has never undergone heart\\n\\ncatheterization.  She is currently undergoing evaluation for a\\n\\nthyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule. \\n\\n \\n\\nJorgenson, Vivian Lea\\n\\nMR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071\\n\\n \\n\\nIssue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: \\n\\ngiven that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden\\n\\nsince 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with\\n\\nimaging. If this is similar to her previous study showing only\\n\\nfixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she\\n\\nwill be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative\\n\\nmyocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is\\n\\nwell treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having\\n\\nsurgery.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIssue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection\\n\\nfraction.  She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection\\n\\nfraction. As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation\\n\\nand she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or\\n\\nrhythm.  Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days\\n\\nprior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after\\n\\nsurgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons\\n\\nas to how may days she should wait after surgery before\\n\\nrestarting that medication.  She will otherwise remain on her\\n\\ncurrent medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and\\n\\nprimary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.  If her stress test\\n\\nis without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for\\n\\nfurther evaluation.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThank you for referring this interesting patient. She was seen\\n\\nand examined with Dr. Voss. \\n\\n \\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPamela Imperial, M.D. \\n\\nPI/waldron\\n\\n \\n\\ncc:\\n\\nCharles Van, M.D.\\n\\n \\n\\nJordan, FL  83712\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it.  \\n\\n\\n\\nHe began the Captopril and HCTZ (? or Maxide) and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH.  At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved.  He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself.  His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 140 to 150 range fasting.  On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170.  \\n\\n\\n\\nHe has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month.  \\n\\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today he looks well and comfortable.  His blood pressure is 140/76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68.  His weight is 173 (stable).  \\n\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program.  Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program.  \\n\\n\\n\\nWe will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today.  He will return in four months for follow up.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrvell Oliver, M.D. \\n\\nLabs:  Hemolyzed sample shows K of 6.0.  Will check re HCTZ vs Maxide.

He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis. He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning. \\n\\nHis episodes of chest pain are interesting. He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching. The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset. They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge. He is otherwise in fairly good health.\\n\\n\\n\\tPast medical history:\\n   1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis \\n2) Palpitations \\n3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tAllergies:\\n\\t\\nNo known drug allergy\\n\\n\\n\\tMedications (Confirmed):\\n\\n\\t\\naspirin  81 mg po daily\\npenicillin VK  500 mg po 4 x day\\n\\n\\n\\tFamily history:\\n   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. \\n\\n\\n\\tSocial history:\\n   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine.\\n\\nHabits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.\\n\\n\\n\\tReview of systems:\\n   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.\\n\\nPhysical examination:\\n\\t\\n-BP: 110/70  \\n-Pulse: 59  BPM regular\\n-resp. rate: 16  unlabored\\n-Skin:   without lesions or nodules.\\n-HEENT:   EOMI.

No oropharyngeal lesions.\\n-Neck:   carotids 2+ without bruits; jugular venous pressure &lt;5 cm of water; thyroid without nodules; trachea midline.\\n-Chest:   lungs clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion, and symmetric in expansion.\\n-Cardiac:   regular with a normal S1/S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\\n-Abdomen:   soft, nontender, without organomegaly or other masses.\\n-Extremities:   no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\\n-Neuro:   reflexes were 1+; cranial nerves 2-12 were intact; motor and sensory modalities were intact in all four extremities.\\n\\n\\n\\tEKG:\\n   10/28/2078: Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.\\n\\n\\n\\tAssessment and plan:\\n   Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort. Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se. It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past. \\n\\nWe will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed. \\n\\nI will certainly keep you informed about how things progress. \\n\\nYours truly, \\n\\nNorman C.

They both attribute it to the Prilosec.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.  He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.\\n\\n\\n\\nAllergies and nasal congestion are not evident.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.\\n\\n\\n\\nMildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn examination, he is well appearing.  Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored. Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff. Conjunctivae are clear.  Oropharynx is clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy. Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.  Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.  JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.\\n\\n\\n\\nPulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.  \\n\\n\\n\\nImpression:\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\tInterstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.  Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.  There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.  He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\tGE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.  If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\tPossible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\tPossible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.\\tChronic cough.\\n\\n\\n\\n6.\\tDiabetes - Better controlled.\\n\\n\\n\\n7.\\tObesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.  As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\tContinue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d. dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\tReferral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\tCardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt has been a pleasure to participate in his care.

He has been feeling pretty well though he is\\n\\ndistressed at his 18-pound weight gain.  His sugars were in the 300s before starting\\n\\nthe insulin.  Since he started the insulin, his sugars have come down nicely.  His\\n\\nfasting sugars have been in the 120s.  His afternoon sugars have been in the 70-90s. \\n\\nHe had a few hypoglycemic episodes early on but has not had some in almost a\\n\\nmonth.  Other than that, he really has no new complaints.  He is still not smoking. \\n\\nHe is still on the patch.  His neuropathy has not gotten any worse and he thinks he\\n\\ncan stop the Neurontin now.  He has not had any shortness of breath, cough or\\n\\nedema.\\n\\n\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.  No GI symptoms, no GU symptoms and no\\n\\nnew skin symptoms, no arthritic complaints. \\n\\n\\n\\nHABITS: Not smoking or drinking.  Not getting much exercise now.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM: His blood pressure is 140/80 on the left, 150/80 on the right. \\n\\nHis pulse is 76 and regular.  Respirations are 16.  Lungs are clear. Heart: Regular\\n\\nrate and rhythm, negative M/R/G.  No bruits heard.  Nasopharynx unremarkable. \\n\\nAbdomen is benign.  He has diminished pulses but good capillary refill in the feet. \\n\\nThe cellulitis on the left ankle is completely resolved.  He has some neuropathy of\\n\\nthe feet with decreased sense to vibration in both feet, but his sensation to\\n\\nmonofilament is intact on both feet. \\n\\n\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \\n\\n\\n\\n(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c today.  It may still be a little bit\\n\\n     high as he has undergone a rather brisk change since starting his insulin.  I\\n\\n     encouraged him to check his sugars a couple times a week, especially in the\\n\\n     afternoon.  If he continues to get low sugars, will cut back on his morning\\n\\n     insulin to 35 units.  He is going to bring in a form for custom shoes given his\\n\\n     neuropathy and is followed closely by Podiatry.  He had an eye exam earlier\\n\\n     this year with Dr. Yousif.\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)  Hypertension.  Will increase his Mavik to 4 mg a day.\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)  Hyperlipidemia.  Recheck lipids and SGOT today.\\n\\n\\n\\n(4)  CAD prevention.  He can't take aspirin so we will start Plavix 75 mg a day.\\n\\n\\n\\n(5)  Status-post splenectomy.

She is \\ncurrently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d., nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO \\nq.d., and potassium chloride 10 ml. equivalents PO q.d.  Patient comes in \\ntoday for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine \\nbaseline examinations.  On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160/90, \\nand on check today it was 150/90.  We discussed the possibility that she \\ncontinue her salt-restricted diet.  We also discussed that she continue \\nher own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed \\nthe possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.  She currently \\nweighs 199 lbs. and stands approximately 4\\'9\" tall.  \\n \\nAs far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood \\npressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that \\ntime if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine \\nXL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly \\ngain some better control or possibly adding another agent.  However, at \\nthis point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure \\nand this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood \\npressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the \\n200s-190s.\\n \\n \\nHer family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation \\nnow appears to be much more stable.  She is currently living with her \\nmother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good \\nabout her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.  \\n \\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no \\nmurmurs.  Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal \\ntenderness.  She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace \\nswelling bilaterally at the ankles.   Breast exam: no evidence of masses \\nor lumps.\\n \\nShe will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a \\nmammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool \\nguaiacs.

He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH. Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT. Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him. He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImpression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH. I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future. I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA. He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuinton H.

Her problems are as follows:\\n \\n1.   Diabetes.  She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose \\n     and she was put on insulin by me.  Xitlali Xia followed her in \\n     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as \\n     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.  \\n     She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any \\n     list of her blood sugars.  She says she does take them about twice a \\n     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and \\n     threw them away.  She says that they never go higher than 200; that \\n     they usually are about 110.  It was 101 this morning before \\n     breakfast, she says.  She says it does get as low as 19 and five or \\n     six times it has been below 50.  She does say she eats three regular \\n     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten \\n     breakfast she said no.  She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.\\n \\n     I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.  I expressed to her again how \\n     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.  \\n     She had been eating a lot of chocolate.  She says she has gotten off \\n     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it \\n     then.  She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will \\n     help her with her diet.  If her diet does get better, maybe we can \\n     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.  I explained to her, too, \\n     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might \\n     be able to get her off the insulin.  This seemed to be something that \\n     she would like to do.  Hopefully the nutritionist can help.  I also \\n     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her \\n     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, \\n     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was \\n     really going on and whether they are getting too low.  She denies any \\n     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.  I am \\n     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.  \\n     She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no \\n     nothing.  She felt totally normal.  So hopefully she will really \\n     record these and we will get a better idea.  She said this always \\n     happens in the morning.  She kept contradicting herself and had no \\n     documentation.  I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.  \\n     Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.  She does drink juice, \\n     but I went over the symptoms again with her.  She will call me if she \\n     does have any.\\n                                              10-19-86\\n \\n \\n \\n2.   Left ankle pain.  I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.  \\n     She said that she may do some surgery on her.\\n \\n3.   Dysuria.  She says this is totally resolved after giving her the \\n     Bactrim.\\n \\n4.   Yeast infection.  She said this has also resolved.\\n \\n5.   She complains of headache.  She says these have been going on for two \\n     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.  \\n     She has had nausea and vomited once.  This happened pretty much every \\n     day and it can be at any time of the day.  Tylenol and Advil did not \\n     help.  She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in \\n     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.  \\n     But she has no further prodrome.  She says it is a banging kind of \\n     pain that is rhythmic.  She also says she does see stars in front of \\n     her eyes when it happens.  I asked her if she had any hearing loss, \\n     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there \\n     sometimes.  It has been happening for a couple of weeks.  I discussed \\n     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like \\n     migraines.  I will not image her head now as there is no evidence \\n     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.  Her neuro exam \\n     was totally normal.  Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.  \\n     Her gait was normal.  Light touch was touched.  Her toes were \\n     downgoing.  Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.  Her disks were \\n     sharp.  EOMI, PERRL.  I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO \\n     t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind \\n     her left ear.  I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.\\n \\n6.   Health maintenance.  I thought that since she is diabetic and obese \\n     that she might benefit from a flu shot.  She has no interest in this \\n     at all.  Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh \\n     cuff.  Her pulse was 96.  Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was \\n     285.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n_________________________\\nXitlali Crane, M.D.\\n \\nCCL:FG:1879\\nDD:10-19-86\\nDT:10-21-86\\nDV:10-19-86\\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot.  He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle.  He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070.  After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity.  He denies any history of trauma.  He is a former smoker.  He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease.  He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.\\n\\n\\n\\nPast surgical history is as above.\\n\\n\\n\\nMedications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d., aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo known drug allergies.\\n\\n\\n\\nReview of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension.  All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.\\n\\n\\n\\nHabits, he is a former tobacco smoker.  He denies alcohol use.\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort.  Respiratory rate is 12-14.  Pulse is 60-70 and regular.  Weight is 172 pounds.  Blood pressure is 170/90 in the right arm, 150/90 in the left.  No jugular venous distention.  Normal respiratory effort.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur or bruit.  He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally.  Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic.  On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals.  He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity.  No varicosities.  He does have dependent rubor, cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes.  The right great toe is blanched.  He has no abdominal masses, tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.  He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis, ulcers or sores.  He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with slightly depressed affect.\\n\\n\\n\\nAssessment and Plan:  \\n\\n\\n\\n1. Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft.  We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours.  We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow  with either thrombolysis and/or angioplasty and stenting.  If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.\\n\\n2. Tobacco abuse:  The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.\\n\\n3. Hypertension:  Moderately controlled on current medications.  His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.  We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.  \\n\\n4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram.  I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.  \\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for allowing me to participate in his management.  If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.  \\n\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShane R.

She had noted on x-ray many years ago that she had had a \\nchipped bone in the right knee and some mild osteoarthritis but it has \\nbothered her only intermittently until this year.  Last year she did go \\nto Briggs Stratton and dropped to 270 lb. at which point her knees felt \\nbetter, but currently she is back up to over 300 lb. and at her height \\nof 5 ft. 1 in., she is in pain.  She has not visited a physician.  She \\nhas no internist who currently checks on her general medical health, but \\nshe does report that the occasional Advil she takes does produce some \\ndyspepsia.  She has no history of gout, no history of psoriasis, no \\nhistory of pseudogout or any rash, alopecia, headaches, shoulder or hip \\ndiscomfort.  She does not complain of back pain but does have difficult \\nwalking 50 yards because of the knee pain.\\n \\nAllergies:  None.\\n \\nMedications:  Occasional Advil.\\n \\nPast Surgical History:  Cholecystectomy 2064.  Two c-sections.\\n \\nPast Medical History:  Negative for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, \\nstroke, tuberculosis, hepatitis, asthma, heart disease.\\n \\nFamily History:  Mother is alive and well with no medical problems.  \\nFather is alive and well with no medical problems.  She has 12 siblings.  \\nOne sibling died of pneumonia at a young age.  Another sibling has \\nasthma.\\n \\nPhysical Examination;  She is a markedly obese female, no apparent \\ndistress.  She is 5 ft. 1 in. and weighs 304 lb.  Examination of joints:  \\nNo evidence of active synovitis or pain in her DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, \\nelbows, shoulders.  Bilateral hips are limited in internal external \\nrotation but not because of pain-- due to obesity, bilateral knees have \\ncrepitus, but no warmth or swelling.  There is some pain at extremes of \\nflexion on the left of 110 degrees.  Ankles and toes within normal \\nlimits.  Please note above in the clinical history that she does not \\ncomplain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because \\nof the knee pain.  The blood pressure could not be taken secondary to \\nthe fact that the large blood pressure \\ncuff did not fit around her right arm. \\n \\nImpression:  \\n \\n1.

She is \\n\\nreferred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.  The patient states she is \\n\\ncurrently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she \\n\\ndeveloped diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.  This continued to bother her \\n\\nand she eventually was treated with steroids.  I am not sure she had a \\n\\ndiagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.  She then was switched to ibuprofen which \\n\\ndid not work particularly well.  Over this time, she would have intermittent \\n\\nepisodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in \\n\\nher palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.  She was seen by \\n\\nDr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states \\n\\nshe had \"25 shots\" of steroids.  She denies any hot or swollen joints.  She \\n\\nhas had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.  Extensive ROS reveals \\n\\nno photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud\\'s.  She \\n\\nhas urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly \\n\\nwell.  She has continued to be concerned about that.  She has had fevers or \\n\\nchills but no temperature elevation.  She has intermittent abdominal pain but \\n\\nhas had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.  She has \\n\\nmorning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.  Mother is \\n\\n85.  Two sons alive and well.  Two siblings alive and well except for \\n\\nhypertension and hypercholesterolemia.\\n\\n\\n\\nPast medical history is pertinent for above.  She has had a partial \\n\\nhysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist.  Medications \\n\\ninclude for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following: \\n\\nmetformin 500 b.i.d., verapamil 240 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg \\n\\nq.d., Bumex 20 q.d., cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d., and Allegra.  \\n\\nNo smoking or drinking history.  No allergies.  No other medical problems.\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown.  She works as a \\n\\nmidwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic.  Her husband is \\n\\na Broadcast Technician.  They have traveled quite a bit because of this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYesenia Olive, M.D.\\n\\nRE:  Gerald, Marion \\n\\nMRN: 48967301 \\n\\nPage 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhysical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress.

Gout.  This has been present for 7 years.  Evaluated at Mary by\\nDr. Farrar.  Treated with Colchicine.  He cut down the amount of\\norgan meats and red meat that he had been eating at the time.  He has\\nnot had any alcohol for 11 years.  Strong family history in his father\\nand all his brothers.  Continues to have 4 or 5 relatively mild flares\\na year which are frequently attributable to forgetting to take the\\nColchicine.\\n \\nPMH:  Tonsillectomy.  Cervical radiculitis.  He is a recovering\\nalcoholic.  No alcohol for 11 years.  Hypertension when he was\\ndrinking.  Hidradenitis.  \\n \\nMeds:  Colchicine 0.6 mg q.d.  \\n \\nALL:  None.\\n \\nFH:  Father died at 57 from an MI.  Mother at 60 in her sleep. \\nBrothers have gout, one has hypertension.\\n \\nSH:  Married for the second time.  His wife is Emily Ippolito another\\npatient of mine.  They will have been married for one year in May. \\nHe works as a Patternmaker for McCall in Enid.  He averages 1 1/2\\npacks of cigarettes a day for the last 35 years.  No alcohol.  No drugs\\nor HIV exposure.\\n \\nROS:  Bifocals. Slightly decreased hearing in the left ear.  No chest\\npain.  Has a chronic AM cough bringing up 1/4 cup of phlegm daily.  He\\noccasionally plays tennis and bicycles.  He believes his cholesterol\\nwas 170.  Does like high cholesterol food but has cut back because his\\nwife has a problem.  He uses seat belts.\\n \\nOn physical examination he is a very pleasant large white male.  His\\nweight is 222 lbs., blood pressure 128/88, heart rate 72.  HEENT -\\nEOMI, PERL, fundi negative.  Cerumen impacted against the TM's.  Benign\\noral cavity examination.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Lungs\\nclear.  No murmurs or gallops.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No testicular\\nmasses or hernias.  Normal prostate, guaiac negative stool.   Absent\\ndistal pulses.  2+ femoral pulses without any bruits.  1+ reflexes.  No\\nswelling or tenderness over the first MTP's.  Neurologic exam shows\\nhearing decreased to watch tick bilaterally.  Air conduction is greater\\nthan bone.  Weber is not lateralized.  \\n \\nImpressions and plans:  1.  Gout.  It sounds like this is really not\\nmuch of a problem when he remembers to take the Colchicine.  I\\nencouraged him to make this a regular habit.  We will check a random\\nuric acid level.\\n \\n2.  Cardiac risk factors.  He is a male with a very positive family\\nhistory who is a smoker.  He has significant cardiac risk factors.  We\\nspent a long time talking about smoking today.  At his request I gave\\nhim a prescription for Nicoderm patches.  He will start at 21 mg for\\nsix weeks and then move to 14 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mg for 2 weeks.  We\\nwill check a cholesterol and he should be less than 200 given his risk\\nfactors.  I pointed out to him his evidence by history of chronic\\nbronchitis and of peripheral vascular disease.  I think he found this\\nsobering.\\n \\n3.  General health.  We discussed exercise, cholesterol and seat belts.\\nWe also discussed the use of Q-Tips which I think may also be a\\nsignificant contributing factor to his decreased hearing and the\\nimpaction of cerumen.  I recommended ear drops.  We can have him tested\\nformally when he becomes interested in intervention.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nXzavior C.

       " '\\n\\nRecord date: 2085-04-22\\n\\n \\nThis patient wants to transfer his care from the McCook Erie Clinic to me. He \\ngot \\nmy name from a nurse who works in the hospital.  HE is a 58 year old white \\nmale retired Transportation Manager with a number of issues.  \\n1)  He had a cyst or a mass enlarge in his R submental region which was \\nexcised \\nat the McCook Erie Clinic.  Note from his surgeon there said the path showed \\nnonkaziating granuloma.  I hope cultures are pending.  The patient does \\nvolunteer at a homeless shelter so could  certainly be exposed to TB or \\natypical mycobacteria.  \\n2)  The patient has know mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation followed \\nat the MEC by a cardiologist. He had a stress test in the last year that was \\nbenign. Never had CHF or endocarditis.  \\n3)  Social situation.  The patient is a sober alcoholic and sober for the \\nlast \\n2 years however he went through divorce probably because of his alcoholism \\n10 years ago and took early retirement from Brookdale Metro Systems because \\nof his alcoholism. He stays sober by going to meetings and also \\nvolunteering at the McCook Clinic. He lives with a woman. He has good \\nrelations with his grown children and his grand children.  His woman friend \\nis very supportive and the patient is now feeling good enough about himself \\nthat he is ready to try and get work full time.  Previous attempts to do so \\nhave resulted in failure because of his Hx of alcoholism and his premature \\nretirement.\\n \\nFamily Hx. Father died at age 79 of Altzheimers and some kind of cancer ? \\nthroat cancer.  His mother had diabetes and coronary artery disease and she \\ndied of colon cancer. The patient himself had a colonoscopy within the last \\nyear and it was normal.  One brother and 2 sisters, one of the sisters also \\nhas mitral valve disease. \\n \\nPast medical Hx the alcoholism and he was stabbed in the L hand I think in \\n2059 and that was repaired. He also had a TNA in childhood. \\n \\nHe has no known allergies to medications.\\n \\nThe only medication he takes is Lisinopril 5 mg for blood pressure. He was \\nonly started on this in the last year. He also takes a vitamin a day.\\n \\nHis other significant medical complaint is erectile dysfunction.  He has \\nnormal libido and good sexual drive however he tends to lose erection after \\nhe \\nhas gone for a few minutes.  He can achieve vaginal penetration.  His live in \\nlover has been supportive but she would like him to have better performance \\nand so would he. He does wake up in the morning frequently with erections. He \\nhas no known Hx of diabetes.  No prolonged hypertension or vascular disease.  \\n \\nSocial Hx.  The patient eats fairly well. He walks usually a mile or so a \\nday.  \\nHe does not do any aerobic activity. He does smoke  to a pack a day and has \\nfor many, many years.  He does wear seat belts when he drives and does not do \\nany elicit drugs.  On system review:  Weight stable.  No change in skin. He \\nalways had a very gravelly voice.  He has had no change in his vision. He is \\nvery deaf in the L ear.  He has a morning cough no hemoptysis.  Cough is \\nabout \\na teaspoon of white/gray sputum. He has no dyspnea on exertion.  He has no \\nangina.  No palpitations.  No presyncope or syncope.  NO claudication. He has \\nno dysphagia. He has no epigastric discomfort.  No change in his bowel \\nmovements and no rectal bleeding.  He has no claudication.  No edema and no \\njoint pains. No headaches and no low back pain.  No long bone pain.  He has \\nno \\nheat or cold intolerance.  He has no easy bruisability.  \\n \\nPE: shows him to 5\\'7\".  155 lbs.  Skin benign.  Nails do show some early \\nclubbing. No cyanosis.  Normal no AV knicking.  Flat disks. Pupils equally \\nround and reactive to light and accommodation at 3 mm. Nares normal.  TMs \\nnormal. Hearing is markedly diminished in the L ear. Head is normal cephalic. \\nThyroid not enlarged.  There is the scar at the site of his excision under \\nthe \\nmandible. No associated adenopathy on either R or L neck or axilla or the \\nsupraclavicular region.  He is hyperesonant to percussion.  He has distant \\nbreath sounds. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes. He has normal S1.  Normal S2 and \\nholosystolic blowing 2-3/6 mid systolic murmur radiates best to the axilla. \\nNo \\nradiation to the clavicles. No carotid bruits.  Jugular venous pulsation to 7 \\nsonometers. Abdomen is soft and non tender. There is no enlargement of the \\nliver. No adeventitious masses. There is a L inguinal weakness without frank \\nhernia.  Phallus uncircumsized. Testes normal. Prostate is a little difficult \\nfeel because he has a band around the anal sphincter which makes it difficult \\nfor me to get beyond but I felt probably half of his prostate and it was \\nnormal and smooth. Stool was guac negative. Reflexes 3+ and equal throughout \\nand normal vibratory sense and touch. Normal gait and station.\\n \\nAssessment and Plan:\\n \\n1)  Recent rapidly growing mass under the R mandible showing nonkaziating \\ngranuloma.  Culture is pending and we will plant a PPD and control early \\nnext week. I will have him tracked down the report of this from the MEC and \\nget culture reports and will get chest x-ray today both for his COPD to \\nrule out a cavitary lesion.  \\n2)  Alcoholism now sober.\\n3)  Erectile dysfunction try Viagra. He was given appropriate warnings and \\ninstructions.  I gave him 100 mg # 7.  \\n4)  Mitral valve prolapse by auscultation followed by cardiologist at the MEC.\\n5)  We spent a long time talking about smoking cessation.  He has some \\nWellbutrin at home from when he was depressed while getting sober and I \\nencouraged him to take 150 b.i.d. and we made a plan for him to try and \\nquit.   I will see patient again next week to plant a PPD and then see him \\nagain in about a month to see how he is doing.  We will certainly check the \\nchest x-ray to make sure he did not have active cavitary disease.\\n \\nLeroy X.

HUGHES, MD \\n\\n \\nFOLLOW UP NOTE \\n \\nDIAGNOSIS:  Renal cell carcinoma, presumably metastatic to T1.  Interval since conformal radiation therapy to vertebra T1 to a dose of 50.4 gray:  Three months.  \\n \\nTUMOR STATUS:  Not available.  \\n \\nNORMAL TISSUE STATUS:  No difficulty.  \\n \\nINTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Lagnston is generally doing well with no deterioration and some improvement in his symptomatology.  He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so.  He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight.  He has no weakness in any extremities.  His nocturia has decreased from three to one.  His hands feel a little \"fuzzy.\"  The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right.  \\n \\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he looks well.  His weight is up to 230 pounds.  He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout.  His abdomen is entirely negative, so is his incision.  \\n \\nIMPRESSION:  Clinically possibly slightly improved, certainly no evidence of progression.  \\n \\nPLAN:  I will obtain a repeat chest and thoracic spine CT, as well as a bone scan.  Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months.  Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are.

I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,\\n2092.  Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.\\n \\nMs. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal\\nfailure of unknown etiology.  She is six years status post\\nhysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult\\nleiomyosarcoma was discovered.  She has an extensive history of\\nhidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension.  She had one stillborn\\ninfant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions. \\nSFOC records are unavailable at this time.\\n \\nHer medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,\\nfurosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,\\nNiferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex\\n250 mg qid.\\n \\nOn physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no\\ndistress.  Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs.  Temperature\\nis normal.  Pulse is 88 beats per minute.  Blood pressure is\\n178/96.  There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.  There is a\\nbuffalo hump.  The lungs show scattered wheezing.  Cardiovascular\\nexam is normal.  There are discolorations of the skin across the\\nneck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not\\nraised.  The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.  There is a\\nventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.  The\\nextremities show trace edema.  There are several areas of\\nsuperficial petechiae.\\n \\nIn summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of\\nunclear etiology.  She does report an episode of lower extremity\\nswelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.  ThisRoberta Vincent\\nMR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092\\n \\n \\nraises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now\\nin a chronic phase.  Other diagnostic possibilities include other\\nforms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus\\nerythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions. \\nNevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this\\ntime given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased\\nrisk due to her body habitus.\\n \\nI discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.\\nVincent. Although she has no medical conditions which would\\npreclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her\\nobesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of\\nhidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.  I have\\nencouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in\\norder to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or\\ntransplantation.  Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent\\nof Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not\\nbeen performed previously.\\n \\nI have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her\\nkidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to\\nmeet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV\\nfistula or placement of a graft.\\n \\nThank you once again for your kind referral.\\n \\nRespectfully,\\n \\n \\n \\nElias Q.

Also \\nwith a history of borderline hypertension previously on \\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d. for the last year, which he discontinued \\nlast Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks \\nhe has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and \\nhe is afraid that his sugar is up.  He states that over the last two or \\nthree weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light \\nfollowed by mild headaches.  He says that the visual changes are usually \\naccompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with \\nExcedrin in 5 minutes to an hour.  He does admit to a history of \\nmigraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more \\nsevere than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous \\nmigraine aura.  \\n \\nHe states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time \\nthey did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come \\nto this appointment at this time.  He denies any fevers.  He does have a \\nrecent 25 lb weight gain and he admits to new nocturia of 2-3 times a \\nnight over the last three weeks.  He also has been complaining of \\ndiarrhea two or three times a week over the last two to three weeks, \\nwhich is watery in nature without any blood.  He has no nausea or \\nvomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like \\nthis in the past.  His past medical history is otherwise benign.  \\n \\nHabits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free \\nbasing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest \\npain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart \\nfrom the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less \\nfrequently.  He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.  \\nHe is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.  He is sexually \\nactive with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors.\\n \\nFamily History:  His family history is notable for a grandmother with \\ndiabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with \\nhistory of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here.  \\nHis oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is \\nalive and well without any medical problems. \\n \\nPhysical Examination;  He is a mildly obese black male in no acute \\ndistress with weight of 270 lbs.  Blood pressure 138/88 in the right arm \\nand 132/94 in the left arm.  Pulse regular at about 80.  HEENT was \\nnotable for normal fundi without any evidence of diabetic retinopathy or \\nhypertensive retinopathy.  Oropharynx was clear.  He had no thyromegaly.  \\nHis chest was clear.  His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his \\n                                              1-29-62\\n \\n \\n \\nheart sounds were normal.  His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, \\nwithout any hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally \\ndescended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace \\nheme positive stool.  Neurologic exam was intact. \\n \\nAssessment and Plan:  \\n \\n1.   Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased \\n     sugar at this time.  Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow \\n     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta \\n     to 10 mg. q.d.  He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet \\n     control as well.  \\n2.   Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.  I \\n     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it \\n     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt \\n     diet.  \\n3.   Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.  I will get a \\n     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to \\n     three weeks, and follow it at this time.\\n4.   Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this \\n     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result \\n     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this \\n     time.  \\n \\n \\n_________________________\\nCadence Barton, M.D. \\n \\nFL:RP:2786\\nDD:1-29-62\\nDT:1-30-62\\nDV:1-29-62\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance. Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well. Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications). Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week.

Patient says he was diagnosed \\nas having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker \\nXian and was treated with steroids at the time. It\\'s not clear what CNS \\nor neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time. Because of complex \\npartial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who \\nreferred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his \\nestradiol level was in the 80s. His testosterone was up but available \\ntestosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he \\nsaid turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures. Said he was doing \\nfine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred. He \\nsaid his neck felt full and warm. His head felt like it was going to \\nexplode. He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was \\nvibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn\\'t \\nright. Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and \\npostnasal drip. Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and \\nanti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don\\'t have any \\nother results). He\\'s had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis \\non his legs. No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth \\nor gum except that he has to wear his glasses. Recently had some teeth \\nremoved. Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough. No other \\ncardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension. No GI \\nproblems. Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to \\nbenign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR.

Exercises.\\n \\nRecent MRI consistent with a \"vasculopathy.\"\\n \\nFamily history. Mother died of colon cancer at 62, smoked. Father died \\nat 62 of heart attack, stroke and insulin dependent diabetes, also \\nsmoked. He is an only child.\\n \\nSocial history. Doesn\\'t smoke. When he\\'s depressed he becomes a binge \\ndrinker. Exercises when he\\'s not depressed. He\\'s retired since 2103. Was \\na stage manager.\\n \\nPhysical exam. Somewhat overweight gentleman. Blood pressure was 160/80. \\nPulse was 88 and regular. Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on \\nforearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees. One \\nsmall node in the left side of his neck. Mouth and throat was clear. \\nBilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left. Ear drums fine. \\nHearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the \\nforehead). Chest clear. No CVA tenderness. Heart: No murmurs.

On the last visit he was having \\nchest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further \\nevaluation.  At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any \\nischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.  \\nThe Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in \\nthe past with a decreased LV function.  However repeat echo within the \\npast months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process \\nof performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the \\nHumbert Hospital against medical advice.  After being evaluated in the \\nEmergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with \\nthe Internal Medicine clinic.  \\n \\nMedications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include \\nCarafate 1 gm. PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO \\nq.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d. p.r.n. and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.  His \\ninsulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m. and 18 units q.p.m. \\nand regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.  \\n \\nOn return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest \\npain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since \\ndiscontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.\\n \\nPhysical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate \\nof 76.  He is not in any acute distress.  His chest is clear to \\nauscultation.  His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart \\nsounds.  His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.  His \\nrectal exam is guaiac negative.  His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ \\npitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.  \\n \\nAssessment and Plan:  \\n \\n1.   Cardiac.  The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study \\n     to rule out ischemia.\\n \\n2.   Hypertension.  His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.\\n \\n3.   Diabetes.  His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick \\n     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.\\n \\n4.

He is a 72-year-old man with CAD S/P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC, found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA.  Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia, he was brought to ECI, where Dr. Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3.5mm by 32mm Taxus drug-eluting stent, with zero percent residual.  The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal, and there were no complications.  \\n\\n\\n\\nHe spent an uneventful evening without complaints, ambulating without difficulty.  His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit, and extremities were warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9, hematocrit 37, platelets 236,000, and flat cardiac enzymes.  He was discharged home on Plavix, 75mg po qd for a minimum of six months; enteric-coated aspirin, 325mg po qd; digoxin, 0.25mg po qd; glyburide, 5mg po bid; metoprolol, 50mg po bid; Lipitor, 20mg po qd; Tikosyn, 500mcg po bid; Glucophage, to be resumed at 500mg po bid in two days; and Coumadin, to be resumed tonight.

He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit.  He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms.  Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well.  Most recent echo from 5/02/88 showed severely depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%, global hypokinesis with antero-apical akinesis.  Moderate LV margin.  Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement (41 mm.).  Dilated aortic loop.  Normal RV size and function.

Based on this, he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization.  10/87 he underwent stenting X4 of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch.  Notably, his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD, which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery.  The L main had no significant lesions.  The LAD had a 50% lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid-LAD was occluded.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [        ] therapy.

He was seen in MHC \\nclinic prior to that.  His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone \\nnumber is 872-9985.  Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact \\nthat he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has \\nnot seen a physician in the past year.\\n \\nHis medical problems include:\\n1.   Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063.  It is unclear \\n     which vessels were plastied.  \\n2.   Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin \\n     for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia.  However, he has not taken any \\n     niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well. \\n3.   Anxiety.\\n4.   Condyloma last fall.\\n \\nMedications:  1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO \\nq.h.s. prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH.  Patient also had \\nnitroglycerin tablets at home.  Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO \\nt.i.d.; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance.  \\nHe does not have any history of hypertension in the past.\\n \\nSocial history:  He is currently not working.  He has been unemployed for \\na month and a half.  He used to be a social worker which did not \\ninvolve any heavy lifting.  He did community services managment.  He \\nlives with his mother and his sister and has never been married.  \\n \\nReview of systems:  Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of \\nchest pains over the last 10 years.  However, he does say that his last \\nchest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.  When asked where the \\npain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the \\npain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his \\nangioplasty.  He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was \\nrelieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.  At the \\ntime he was just sitting on his couch watching television.  He has no \\nhistory of exertional angina over the last several years.  However, this \\ncomplaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.  He \\ncurrently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on \\nexertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope.\\n \\nOn physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no \\napparent distress.  Temperature was afebrile.  Heart rate was 68 and \\nregular.  Blood pressure was 126/92 in the right arm in a sitting \\nposition.  HEENT was within normal limits.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  \\nHeart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  \\nAbdomen was benign.  Extremities were without edema or lesions.\\n \\nMHC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Orta, Phil\\nPage 2                                        55931516\\n                                              8-02-73\\n \\n                                              \\n                                              \\nAssessment and Plan:\\n \\n1.   Cardiovascular.  Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given \\n     his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest \\n     pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.  Given that he is on \\n     no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to \\n     initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d. in an attempt to \\n     control his blood pressure and heart rate.  I also encouraged him to \\n     continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of \\n     nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.  \\n     The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and \\n     maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.  After he \\n     has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an \\n     outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any \\n     evidence of ischemia at this time.  If he does, we will recommend a \\n     cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be \\n     causing syms of rest angina.  The case was discussed with any \\n     cardiacs that are on call.\\n \\n2.   Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an \\n     SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does \\n     have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also \\n     has at a level of 336.  He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in \\n     the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year.  I \\n     instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his \\n     diet and explained which food contain those products.  I will also \\n     initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease \\n     both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.  We will start him \\n     off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d. later this week.\\n \\n3.   Daily anxiety.  Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to \\n     control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without \\n     Ativan.\\n \\n4.   History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.  Patient \\n     states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on \\n     his next visit.  If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for \\n     liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.\\n \\nMHC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Orta, Phil\\nPage 3                                        55931516\\n                                              8-02-73\\n \\n                                              \\n                                              \\n5.

       " \"\\n\\nRecord date: 2089-04-13\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nApril 13, 2089 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuadarius Kirk, M.D.  \\nCarrizoza Health Center \\n531 Westfield St \\nClifton Forge, WI  11674 \\n \\nRE:  Parrish, Christopher \\nSFC#:  553-15-48 \\n \\nDear Dr. Kirk:  \\n \\nI had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today.  He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria.  The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.  An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.  The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.  The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.  Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.  There was no critical carotid stenosis.  He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale.  He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.  His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.  It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.  He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.  He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.   \\n\\n\\nSince his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.  He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.  He has no symptoms of aphasia.  He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.  I would agree with him.  He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.  Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.  He has not had any problems with spasms.   \\n\\n\\nHis past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.  He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.  He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.  His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.  He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.  He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.  He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.  \\n \\nHis medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o. q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o. q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.  He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.  He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.  I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.  He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.  \\n \\nThe patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.  The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.  There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke.  \\n \\nOn examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.  His blood pressure was 150/90.  His language was intact.  His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.  He was alert and oriented.  His conversation was appropriate.  The visual fields were full.  The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.  Facial sensation was normal.  There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.  The tongue and palate were midline.  The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.  There was atrophy of the left biceps.  There was full range of motion of the joints.  The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors.  The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.  His right side was 5/5.  He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.  His right toe was downgoing.  Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.  I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.  Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.  He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.  \\n \\nMr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.  He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.  I hope that this will be the case.  Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.  I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.  His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.  I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent.  I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.  The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.  I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.  However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.  He should continue on an aspirin a day.  He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.  I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.  We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.   This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.  After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.  I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.  I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.  \\n \\nThe patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.  \\n \\nSincerely, \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nJohnathan Kiefer, M.

He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia 4 years ago.  He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least 3 miles without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly.   At concert on day of admission, he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain, 8/10, no radiation, associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis.  Pt reported some associated back pain with onset, like \"I was being crushed like a sandwich.\"  Was not eating at time, not like heartburn, no fevers, chills, cough, or chest trauma.  EMT was called-2 SL ntg relieved pain, was given ASA. \\n\\n\\n\\nOn arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free.  His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.  On hindsight, EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III,    mm aVF, 1mm STD in I, ? aVL with biphasic T in I, TWI in aVL.  He received ASA and SLTNG\\n\\nCardiac RF include tobacco (1/2 ppd x 30 yrs) and early family hx (Dad died of MI, first MI at 41).  No known HTN, DM, or hyperlipidemia.  \\n\\n\\n\\nCourse on floor:\\n\\n\\n\\nSeen for initial H&P when patient came to CCU5.

He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.  While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as \"sharp burning pressure\".  He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes. There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.  An EKG was \"normal\" and he was discharged on NG. Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized. On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have \"diffuse CAD\" involving several vessels. Stent placement was not attempted. His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward. A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: \\n\\n\\nASA 81 mg\\nPlavix 75 mg po qd\\nBisoprolol 5mg po qd\\nIsosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm\\nRanitidine 300 mg po qd\\nLipitor 40 mg po qd\\nA sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs\\nMetformin 1000 mg po bid\\n\\n\\nMr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital. He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes. It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:\\n\\n\\nTesting performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.  Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.  No chest pain was    reported.  Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.    The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.  See exercise report for full ECG details.        Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.      There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.  Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%. No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.       Trace mitral regurgitation.4.  Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.      All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.\\n  \\nMr. Austin has  Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in January.

As you\\nknow, he recently had a complicated hospital course.  He underwent\\ncardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD\\nincluding 70% and 90% stenoses.  The first marginal branch had a\\n60% ostial stenosis.  The right coronary artery had 60 and 80%\\nstenoses, respectively.  The PDA had a 70% narrowing.  Given his\\nvery significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided to\\nproceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as\\nthe obtuse marginal.  It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel,\\nand not worth going after at this time.  The RCA was successfully\\nstented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left\\nventricular branch.  By the end of the procedure, flow had been\\nrestored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch,\\nbut Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial\\ninfarction.  Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular\\nbranch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated.  \\n \\nMr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure. The second\\nexercise test was performed with MIBI imaging.  He exercised for\\nnine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol, and experienced chest\\npain.  He had a maximal blood pressure of 148/72 and a heart rate\\nof 121.  MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial\\ninfarction of the basal 1/3 of the inferior wall.  There was\\nmoderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the\\nterritory of the RCA.\\n \\nGiven these findings, it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts\\nundergo bypass surgery.  \\n \\nMr. Potts was discharged on aspirin, Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d.,\\nAtorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s., Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., Imdur 60 mg q.d. \\nHe also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin.\\n \\nOf note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress\\nrecently.  His 89-year-old mother has been at Whitehead recovering\\nWilliam Potts\\nMR#  109-16-75-8              -2-       January 5, 2070\\n \\nfrom a hip fracture.  He is having difficulty arranging the\\nappropriate insurance to cover her medications. \\n \\nMr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.  This\\noccurs with increased activity, and is relief with either rest\\nand/or 1 nitroglycerin.  He has decreased his work level\\nconsiderably, and is relatively sedentary.\\n \\nOn physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress.  He had\\na blood pressure of 112/70, with a heart rate of 60.  His weight\\nwas 203 pounds.  Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. \\nCardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced PMI\\nwith a normal S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. \\nCarotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.   His abdomen is soft,\\nnontender.  There is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux. \\nExtremities are without edema.\\n \\nElectrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61. \\nIntervals are .16/.08/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees. There are\\nflipped T-waves in III and AVF.   I did not have an old\\nelectrocardiogram here for comparison.\\n \\nTherefore, Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with\\nmild exertion.  He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass\\nsurgery.  He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work\\nby his physicians, that the Screen Actor's Guild will make a good case for this. \\nThere has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to\\nreturn to work as an actor.   Given Mr. Potts's current\\nfeeling, I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon\\nas possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery.\\n \\nIt is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his 89-\\nyear-old mother at home, along with his wife.  His mother currently\\nuses a walker, and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot\\nexert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in\\nthe house.  He understands this, and if his chest pain should\\nbecome more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediately\\ncall me.  \\n \\nIf Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery, I will see him in two\\nweeks at NDNH.  \\n \\nWith best regards.\\n \\nSincerely, \\n \\n \\nOlivia Xing, M.D.\\nMonmouth Medical Center\\n81 Clergy Street\\nCasper, NV 33182William Potts\\nMR#  109-16-75-8              -3-       January 5, 2070\\n \\n \\nDD: 01/05/70\\nDT: 01/06/70\\nDV: 01/05/70\\n \\ncc:\\nEarl Jacob, M.D.\\nCardiac Surgery\\nLaurel Regional Hospital\\n96 Clergy Street\\nCasper, NV 33182 \\n \\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The details of the study include an exercise\\n\\n  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and\\n\\n  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from\\n\\n  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and\\n\\n  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a\\n\\n  rate pressure product of 33,390).  The test was stopped due\\n\\n  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.  EKG\\n\\n  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and\\n\\n  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her\\n\\n  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and\\n\\n  verapamil 240mg q.d.  A recent lipid panel demonstrated a\\n\\n  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing\\n\\n  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute\\n\\n  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.  Jugular\\n\\n  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.  Carotids\\n\\n  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.  Chest\\n\\n  examination was clear to auscultation.  Heart examination\\n\\n  demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split\\n\\n  S2, no murmurs or rubs.  Abdominal examination was \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  RE:  Adler, Imogene\\n\\n  MRN: 618-13-82-6\\n\\n  Page 2\\n\\n  March 23, 2079\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  unremarkable.  Peripheral examination demonstrated no\\n\\n  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal\\n\\n  EKG.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive\\n\\n  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the\\n\\n  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery\\n\\n  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.  We reviewed the\\n\\n  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary\\n\\n  angiography and possible angioplasty.  I made no solid\\n\\n  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty\\n\\n  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead\\n\\n  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical\\n\\n  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and\\n\\n  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of\\n\\n  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and\\n\\n  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom\\n\\n  tolerance.  She and her husband are going to reflect on\\n\\n  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the\\n\\n  week.  If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography\\n\\n  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately\\n\\n  in Cardiology.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see\\n\\n  her in the office.

She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.  She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.  She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.  There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.  She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.  She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.  There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.  The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.  The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.  She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.  She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.  Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.  She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.\\n\\nHer past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d. and atenolol 50 mg q.d.  She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.  Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.\\n\\nSocial history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.\\n\\nReview of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.\\n\\nOn exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular.  Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.  Head and neck were unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.  There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.  There is no S3.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  Calf site is clean without bruits.  Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.\\n\\nHer resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.\\n\\nOther lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000.  Liver function tests are normal.\\n\\nA portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.\\n\\nMrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.  She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.\\n\\nAt this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates.  We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.  She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.  At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nYakov Ferris, MD\\n\\n\\nDictated By: Yakov Ferris\\n\\n\\neScription document:5-4672574 BFFocus\\n\\n\\n\\nDD: 09/03/74\\nDT: 09/03/74\\nDV: 09/03/74\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.  As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.  Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.  When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.  At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.  Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.  Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.  Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.  He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.  He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.  We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tPast medical history:\\n\\n   Hypertension.\\n\\nHyperlipidemia.\\n\\nCAD.\\n\\nPAD.\\n\\nPrior tobacco use.\\n\\nObesity.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes mellitus.\\n\\nDepressive disorder.\\n\\nCervical spine disease.\\n\\nCongenital hypospadias.\\n\\nProstatitis.\\n\\nHemorrhoids.\\n\\nColonic polyps.\\n\\nChronic normocytic anemia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tMedications (Confirmed):\\n\\n\\t\\n\\naspirin  325 mg qd\\n\\nAtacand  15 mg qd\\n\\ndoxepin \\n\\nglyburide \\n\\nLipitor  80 mg qd\\n\\nLopid  600 mg BID\\n\\nToprol XL  50 mg qd\\n\\nWellbutrin \\n\\n\\n\\nPhysical examination:\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n-Pulse:   66 and regular\\n\\n-General:   Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress\\n\\n-Heent:   Benign\\n\\n-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits\\n\\n-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs\\n\\n-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.

Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.  On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.  We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.  Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e. CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.  Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.  Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.  We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.  He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.  He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.  With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.\\n\\n\\n\\nParamount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.  We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.\\n\\n\\n\\nChanges to Medications this visit\\n\\n\\t\\n\\nglyburide    \\n\\nToprol XL 50 mg   qd\\n\\nAtacand 15 mg   qd\\n\\nLipitor 80 mg   qd\\n\\nLopid 600 mg   BID\\n\\naspirin 325 mg   qd\\n\\nWellbutrin    \\n\\ndoxepin    \\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for allowing us to participate in his care.

It is located in the lower back, radiating to the back of the legs, to the level of the knees.  The pain is brought on by walking and made better by stopping or sitting down.  Bending over forward also helps the pain.  There is no numbness or weakness associated with the pain.  The pain is better at night than during the day.  The patient has separate pain complaint, which is burning pain in her feet, is worse at night than during the day.  Patient denies bowel or bladder changes. The patient has tried Celebrex, Vioxx and Motrin but has not found any relief for her pain.  She currently does not take any pain medications.  She denies a history of heartburn, gastric or duodenal ulcers or GI bleeds.  She has trouble falling asleep and staying asleep because of the burning pain in her feet. She is being referred to us by Dr. Ebert from Neurosurgery after an MRI scan showed spinal stenosis at L5-S1 and at L4-5 as well as spondylolithiasis between L4 and L5.

As her history is well\\nknown to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.  Mrs.\\nOlivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of\\ncoronary artery disease.  After several catheterizations in the\\n2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease\\n(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071\\nshowed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she\\nwas managed medically.  However, she suffered a non-Q wave\\nmyocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she\\nunderwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary\\nartery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary\\nbypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to\\nher LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse\\nmarginal branch.  She underwent repeat catheterization in February\\nof 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease\\nbut apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.  She\\nunderwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of\\na current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%\\nproximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis\\nwith no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch\\nand a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The saphenous\\nvein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant\\nstenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft\\nto the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the\\nsaphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.  The left\\nintramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete\\nstenoses.  Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of\\nposterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%. \\nShe therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center\\nin early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft\\nto her diagonal artery.  She tolerated this uneventfully and was \\n \\n \\nOlivier, Christine\\nMR #652-33-21-5                    -2-            July 05, 2074\\n \\ndischarged and since then has not had significant exertional chest\\ndiscomfort.  Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild\\nexertional dyspnea.  She has undergone extensive pulmonary\\nevaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which\\nhave revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of\\n1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent\\nwith restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.  In\\naddition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,\\nhypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.  \\n \\nMedications at present:  NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI\\ninsulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric\\ncoated aspirin one tab po q.d., atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Captopril\\n25 mg po t.i.d., amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po\\nq.d., nitroglycerin prn, Nitropatch .2 mg for twelve hours of a\\ntwenty-four hour period, Neurontin 300 mg one tab po t.i.d.,\\nTrusopt one drop ou q.d., Alantin one drop ou q.h.s. and albuterol\\ninhalers two puffs q.i.d. prn.\\n \\nCigarettes - none at present.  \\n \\nPhysical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in\\nno acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heart\\nrate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172\\npounds.  The neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without\\nsignificant bruits.  Chest is clear with a trace right basilar\\nrhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2\\nand a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to\\nthe base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is\\nbenign with bowel sounds well heard.  Extremities without\\nappreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.  There is 1+\\nbipedal edema. \\n \\nElectrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.  PR interval\\nof .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of a\\nleft atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1\\nthrough V3.  \\n \\nImpression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant \\natherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest\\nexertional dyspnea and fatigue.  She denies any active chest\\ndiscomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at\\nalleviating the chest pain syndrome.  The records available to me\\nindicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta\\nblocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an\\nexacerbation of her angina.

Valladares, M.D.\\n\\nMedical Director\\n\\nJanuary 27, 2089\\n\\n\\n\\nMedical Record Number:  8751045  Francisco, Xue\\n\\n\\n\\nProcedure:  The patient is a 56-year-old Spanish-speaking female scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Surgery is scheduled on January 28, 2089 by Dr. Xavier Israel kenneth Xenos.\\n\\n\\n\\nChief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient briefly evaluated on 12/30/88 as part of preoperative evaluation for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy then scheduled for 12/31/88.  Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain.  These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal.  Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting.  Patient denies jaundice.  Today, patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of evaluation on 12/30/88 patients had symptoms of URI and LRI.  She reported back/green sputum, mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandson\\'s inhaler.  After consultation with Dr. Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then follow-up with surgeon to reschedule her surgery.  Patient reports that she went to University Hospital and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler.  Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler.  Currently she denies any symptoms of sputum production, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.  Also denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\\n\\n\\n\\nPatient does have a history of coronary artery disease.  She is status post an MI 11/82.  Patient had cardiac catheterization at OSH 12/3/82 that reportedly showed a critical mid right lesion and a mild left main and left anterior descending lesion.  12/09/82 patient underwent cardiac catheterization at PVH and a PTCA was done.  Patient did well until 10/83 when she was admitted to PVH with symptoms of chest tenderness, left arm pain, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, dry mouth, shortness of breath, dizziness, and darkening of revision.  Patient did rule out for MI by serial enzymes and there are no changes seen on her ECG.  Patient denies any difficulty with chest pain or left arm pain since that time.  She has had episodes of shortness of breath with exertion however, these seem more related to her respiratory status rather than her cardiac disease.\\n\\n\\n\\nStress test done 1/26 showed a normal exercise capacity (METS=7), ECG nondiagnostic for ischemia and the perfusion images were suggestive of anterior ischemia although body habitus limited the interpretation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPast Medical History:  Significant medical problems include:  \\n\\n1.

In brief, the patient is a 81 y/o man with CRI, Type II DM and hypertension who was in his USOH until Thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no  radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  The pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.  EMS was called, who brought him to the HCC ED, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an O2 of 85%.  His pain was alleviated with IV NTG, and BiPap improved his O2 saturation.  He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin.  He was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions.  He was sent to the SDU, where he was started on lasix 60IV BID and a CABG pre-op workup was begun.  Since admission to the SDU, he has been stable, with excellent RA sats.  His Troponin-T peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain.\\n\\tOn the floor, he was stable but had a 15-beat self-limited run of MMVT, his BP was 110/60 and he was asymptomatic, with no chest pain or dyspnea.  He was given 4 gm iv of MgSO4, 60 mEq of KCL.  Repeat cardiac enzymes drawn at the time were significant for a troponin-T of 3.73 but with a CK of 133 (303) and CK-MB of 5.2 (16.2).  \\n\\nPast Medical History:   \\nCAD\\nCHF- EF 38% on TTE on 3/24/64\\nHTN-Took Lisinopril before admission\\nDMII-Takes Glyburide before admission\\nCRI- Baseline Pcr is between 1.6-1.8\\n\\nMedications on transfer:\\nLopressor 12.5 mg PO BID\\nCaptopril 6.25 mg PO BID\\nLipitor 80 mg PO qd\\nZantac 50 mg IV q12h\\nColace 100 mg PO TID\\nInsulin SS\\nASA 325 mg PO QD\\nLasix 60 mg IV QD\\nHeparin IV SS \\n\\nALL:  NKDA\\nSH: Patient quit tobacco 30 years ago, smoked 2 ppd x 34 yrs.

I will review his history for you.  Mr. Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman who states that approximately three months ago, he had some increased swelling of his left leg.  About three to four weeks ago, this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon, Indiana.  At that point, a CT scan was performed.  CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2.0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1.5 cm node just posterior to that, also a 1.0 cm retrocrural node was seen.  CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.  The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter.  The patient was then seen by Dr. Lopez on April 12th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation.\\n\\n\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \\n\\n\\n\\nWegener s granulomatosis initially diagnosed in 2083.  The patient says at that point he came to the Hilton Head Medical Center with severe photophobia and was diagnosed with scleritis.  This recurred in 2093.  He has been treated intermittently with low-dose azathioprine and steroids.  He is currently on a minimal dose of steroids.  \\n\\nstatus post bilateral knee repair\\n\\nstatus post right-sided hip repair\\n\\nhistory of diabetes mellitus type II\\n\\nhiatal hernia\\n\\nhistory of asbestos exposure\\n\\ncoronary artery disease\\n\\nrenal transplant donor s/p left nephrectomy in the 2060s\\n\\n\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  \\n\\n\\n\\nMicronase 10 mg po q day, Lipitor 10 mg po q day, Lasix 40 mg po q day, multivitamin, prednisone 5 mg po q day, Tylenol PM qhs and the patient is currently off of aspirin.\\n\\n\\n\\nALLERGIES:  \\n\\n\\n\\nNo known drug allergies.  No food allergies.\\n\\n\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe patient denies fevers or night sweats.  Does report 30 to 40-pound weight loss over the last year.  Reports increasing fatigue for the last year.  Denies heat or cold intolerance.  Reports his vision has been progressively worse, especially his near vision over the last six to eight months.  His hearing is quite poor especially in his left ear, however has not changed recently.  Has had no effect of sense of smell for the last many years.  Denies trouble chewing or swallowing but does gag when he drinks water intermittently. Denies wheezing.  Does report an intermittent dry cough secondary to nasal drip for the last two weeks.  Reports a runny nose for the last two weeks.  Increase in shortness of breath over the last month.  No muscle pain or muscle aches.  Denies chest pain.  Does report a sensation of burning pressure over his chest lasting approximately 4 to 5 minutes at a time, with exertion, this happens at least once a week, sometimes twice a week, it resolves quickly when he rests.  Denies palpitations.  Does report that he has been bruising more easily over the last several months.  No abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.  Intermittent constipation.  No diarrhea.  No weakness, numbness or changes in his mood or affect.\\n\\n\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe patient lives at home in Bisbee, Indiana with his wife.  His wife is wheelchair bound and he is her sole caregiver.  He has four sons and two daughters.  He has grandchildren, four boys and four girls.  The patient was the long time Chief of Security for Cisco.  This job is currently held by his son.  He smoked about a pack a day from age 14 to age 50 quitting about 26 years ago.  Did drink significantly in the past, but usually only on the weekends, but did not drink everyday.\\n\\n\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe patient s father had colon cancer, which was apparently cured and died at age 87 of old age.  The patient s mother had breast cancer, which was cured and died at age 89 of old age.  The patient s brother had some sort of new cancer in his armpit; the exact histology is unknown.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \\n\\n\\n\\nWeight of 268 pounds, temperature of 97.5, blood pressure of 140/82, pulse of 84 and respiratory rate of 20.  General:  A well-appearing, well-developed gentleman in no apparent distress accompanied by his son today.  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic, thinning head of grey hair.  Pupils are equal round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx is moist.  No mucositis, pharyngitis, thrush or increased lymphoid tissue is seen.  The patient has a scar in the inside of his left buccal mucosa.  He has numerous actinic keratoses over his scalp and behind his left ear.  Otherwise, skin reveals no jaundice, rash or suspicious lesions.  Tongue is midline and well papillated.  The patient has a hearing aid in his right ear.  Neck is supple and somewhat full.  No jugular venous distention or thyromegaly is visible.  Lungs:  Slightly decreased breath sounds throughout and clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Back:  No costovertebral angle or vertebral body tenderness.  There is a very old healed scar in the left posterior flank consistent with prior nephrectomy.  Heart:  Soft systolic ejection murmur, no gallops or rubs, intermittent skipped beats, otherwise regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal.  Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly is palpable.  Extremities:  2+ edema on the right and 3+ on the left, pitting.  Lymph node exam:  No anterior or posterior auricular, no anterior or posterior cervical, no submandibular, submental, infraclavicular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  The patient has a 1.0 cm lymph node deep in the right axilla.  No epitrochlear lymphadenopathy.  Inguinal region:  A 4.0 to 5.0 cm left inguinal lymph node mass is palpated.  Neurologic exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact to specific examination.  Strength 5-/5, bilateral grip, bicep, triceps, deltoids, knee flexion and extension.  Sensory exam intact to light touch bilateral upper extremities and decreased sensation to light touch in the left lower extremity.\\n\\n\\n\\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  \\n\\n\\n\\nRecent laboratory values from April 12th reveals a creatinine of 1.5, glucose of 244 and calcium of 11.  Liver function tests are within normal limits.  Hemoglobin A1c is 6.  White count of 5.2, hematocrit of 33.9 with an MCV of 81 and a platelet count of 155,000.\\n\\n\\n\\nIMAGING STUDIES:  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe patient has a PET/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.  To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.\\n\\n\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \\n\\n\\n\\n1.  Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.  This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.  I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.  I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.  This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.  These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.  I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.  The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.  However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.  I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.  However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.  I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.\\n\\n2.  Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.  If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.  He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.  The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.  In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.  At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.  At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.  The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.\\n\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGene Quadri, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGQ/NV/whalen/whalen\\t\\t28-39407838.doc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\nRecord date: 2071-11-20\\n\\nPatient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941\\nDictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D. \\n\\n \\nDIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome.  \\n \\nHISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.  The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and \"numbness\" on the right worse than left hand.  This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.  Also bothers him during prolonged activity.  He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.  Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.  He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.   \\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.   \\nMEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.  \\n \\nALLERGIES:  None.  \\n \\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.  \\nExamination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.  There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and \\nvery weak opponens.  He has a positive Tinel\\'s, positive Phalen\\'s, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.  His interossei and extensors are full.  Sensation is intact throughout.  \\n \\nEMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.   \\nIMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.  At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as \\npossible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.  We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.  We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.  We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.   \\n__________________________ \\nAndre-Israel Santiago, M.D.  \\n \\nCC:  \\nStephen Mccullough, M.D.  \\nFolsom Convalescent \\nDictated by: _____ \\n \\nDD:11/20/2071 \\nDT:11/22/2071 \\nCH:18306     :0077 \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Though you know her history well, I will\\n\\nrecount it for the purposes of record keeping.  Ms. Yerger is\\n\\npresently 81 years old.  Her vascular risk factors include\\n\\ndiabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  She had no prior diagnosis\\n\\nof coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash\\n\\npulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST\\n\\nelevation myocardial infarction.  Coronary angiography at the\\n\\nTitonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,\\n\\nthrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent\\n\\ncomplete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal\\n\\nas well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.  Angiography also\\n\\nrevealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.  The patient underwent\\n\\nsubsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed\\n\\nby coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.  (SVG to\\n\\nramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).  Ms. Yerger's postoperative\\n\\ncourse was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient\\n\\nepisode of atrial fibrillation.  \\n\\n \\n\\nSince her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of\\n\\nactivity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending\\n\\nshopping trips.  Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve. \\n\\nShe denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.  She has\\n\\nhad persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein\\n\\ngraft harvesting.  She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA\\n\\nsymptoms or claudication.  \\n\\n \\n\\nDetailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.  Ms.\\n\\nYerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on\\n\\nher upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a\\n\\npossible viral exanthem.  \\n\\nYerger, Urania\\n\\nMR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078\\n\\n \\n\\nPast medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency\\n\\n(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and\\n\\nprior right knee replacement.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHer current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.\\n\\nday, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril\\n\\n5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.\\n\\nday, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.\\n\\n \\n\\nSocial History:  The patient lives alone but has many family\\n\\nmembers in the area.  She is currently staying with her daughter. \\n\\nAt baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but\\n\\nis limited by chronic knee pain.  She denies alcohol or tobacco\\n\\nuse.  Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.\\n\\n \\n\\nOn physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.  She is\\n\\ncomfortable seated on the exam table.  Her skin is warm and dry. \\n\\nShe has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly\\n\\non her extremities.  Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate\\n\\nis in the 70's.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her\\n\\ncarotids are 2+ without bruits.  Her chest reveals decreased breath\\n\\nsounds at the left base.  There are no crackles or wheezes. \\n\\nCardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and\\n\\nrhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased. \\n\\nThere was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the\\n\\napex.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her extremities are free\\n\\nof cyanosis or clubbing.  Distal pulses are 1+.

Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to\\n\\npersistent pleural effusion.  We will reevaluate today with a\\n\\nrepeat chest x-ray.  In the meantime, I think that we should\\n\\ncontinue her oral diuretic regimen.  It is possible that her\\n\\npersistent rash is related to her Lasix.  Although not certain to\\n\\nbe successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today\\n\\nin the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may\\n\\nresolve.  I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.  We\\n\\nwill continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for\\n\\nsecondary prevention.  I look forward to seeing her again in\\n\\napproximately eight to twelve weeks.

She continues to\\ncomplain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally\\nsecondary to exertion.  These episodes occur on a roughly once a\\nmonth basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes. \\nAddition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no\\neffect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does\\nnot take Nitroglycerin for it.  A stress test performed last\\nJanuary showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds\\nof a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak\\nblood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.  She had no ischemic\\nEKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI\\nscan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small\\nsurrounding area of transient ischemia.  In addition, there was a\\nmoderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-\\ninfarct mild ischemia.  Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266\\nwith an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192. \\n \\nShe remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d.,\\naspirin 1 tab p.o. q.d, Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., NPH 12 units\\nS.C. q a.m. with 6 units CZI S.C. q a.m., and 15 units NPH S.C. q\\np.m.. \\n \\nPhysical exam reveals a well nourished, overweight woman in no\\nacute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 160/90, heart\\nrate 67 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 264\\npounds, which is six pounds above her weight of one year ago.  The\\nneck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2 + without bruits.  Chest\\n \\n                             Page 2\\n \\nKathy Joshi\\nILC #158-42-11-2\\n11-29-62\\n \\nremains clear.  Cardiac exam reveals normal S1, physiologically\\nsplit S2 and a soft I/VI systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen is\\nbenign.  Extremities without appreciable edema.  \\n \\nElectrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, P-R interval\\n.22, QRS .10, Q-T .36, axis 20 degrees.  There are isolated atrial\\npremature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV block\\nand a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor\\nnonspecific ST and T wave changes.  Compared to his last\\nelectrocardiogram there has been no significant change.\\n \\nImpression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable\\nangina.  I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q h.s.\\nfor her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to\\nmore aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her\\naerobic activity level.  In addition, I have asked her to obtain\\nher blood pressure at least two or three more times on an\\nambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above\\n140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic\\nantihypertensive therapy.  In addition, as long as she remains\\nactive and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI\\nstress test in one to one and a half years time.  Beyond this I\\nhave not altered her present regimen. \\n \\nOf course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care.\\n \\nRespectfully yours,\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBrandon W.

She has multiple medical problems for which she is on a variety of medications, none o which she has taken x1 month as she ran out of refills.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. CVA-She reports 3-4 mos ago she had a stroke (she was told there was a clot in her brain) which left the L side of her face paralyzed and some residual weakness in her LUE. She also notes her handwriting has completely changed since. Since the stroke she has had multiple episodes during which her tongue becomes very heavy and she has difficulty speaking (distinctly different from her now mildly imapired baseline) At these times she feel somewhat confused and her L vison seems blurry. This has happened 4-5 times and lasts all day. er family has encouraged her to seek medical care but she has refused bc she did not think they would do antyhing for her. Of note, pt has not been on ASA as it was d/cd when she changed to celebrex. Pt also c/o memory loss that started even before the CVA.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. CAD-She reports a h/o multiple MIs, incl cardiac cath x2, unknown if she had intevention, she thinks the last was about 1 yr ago. She has stable 3 pillow orthopnea. She becomes SOB when she climbs 5 steps and gets SOB sometimes when she walks, which resolves ith rest, but she is able to walk a fair amt still (cannot pin down how much).  She denies CP with exertion, did have CP with her MIs. She says smx she has lower and upper extremity edema. She has not had a recent ETT.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. DM-Pt has been on glucophage and Humulin 70/30 100U in am and 60 in pm, but has not been monitoring her BS or taking insulin for the past month. She has all the necessary equipment. She says she tries o monior her carb intake. She has been gaining weight, bout 5 lbs in the past 2 mos, and notes polydypsia and polyuria fo the past 2 weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n4. HTN-has not been taking Zestoretic or Atenolol x1 mo\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Depression-Pt has h/o depression for which she has been medicated in the past.

This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.  She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.   The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.  In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.  She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.  She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe recalls one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.  The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.  She has no known history of seizures.  Migraines occur 1-2x/year, preceeded by scintillating scotoma, associated with nausea, photophobia, relieved by sleep.

She has a history of mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's for which she has been followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson. \\n\\nShe reports that for the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion which typically manifests itself when she is trying to climb the 2.5 flights of stairs that she has at home. She feels shortness of breath requiring her to stop when she gets to the top. She denies exertional chest pain or lightheadedness. She denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema. She denies lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope. Currently she reports no symptoms of claudication. No regular exercise. A couple of times a day. Bowls on Sunday night with no shortness of breath. She has also been noted to have a systolic murmur on previous exams. An echocardiogram in 2094 revealed aortic valve leaflet thickening but did not report significant aortic stenosis, though this was a technically difficult study by report. \\n\\nFor evaluation of these symptoms she underwent an ETT-MIBI which was notable for poor exercise capacity, drop in blood pressure, exercise induced LBBB, and perfusion abnormality suggesting distal LAD territory ischemia. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tPast medical history:\\n   1.

She was seen with a very complete evaluation \\n\\nby Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.  She submitted a\\n\\nurine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her\\n\\nurine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.  A fair amount retained\\n\\nas postvoid residual.  Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with\\n\\nresolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor\\n\\nand cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.  She\\n\\nhas anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent\\n\\ninfections.  She is most concerned about having cancer.  She is scheduled to see Dr.\\n\\nQuezada March 24th.  The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have\\n\\nbeen issues going around the housing projects.  A 14-year-old girl was raped and\\n\\none week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment. \\n\\nShe ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.  She did not file a\\n\\npolice report.  As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.  She\\n\\nreports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix\\n\\napproximately one week ago.  She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet\\n\\nsporadically but not on a regular basis.  She denies any chest pressure or\\n\\npalpitations.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She denies any problems with\\n\\npain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm. \\n\\nNo murmurs, gallops or rubs.  UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.  Her\\n\\nankle reveals trace edema on the left.  Her right extremity is warm to palpation.  \\n\\n\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \\n\\n\\n\\n(1)  Hypertension.  Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.  This\\n\\n     may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.  I have\\n\\n     restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d. on a regular\\n\\n     basis.  \\n\\n\\n\\n(2)  Anxiety.  I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try\\n\\n     to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.  She had a urine culture submitted today. \\n\\n     She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.  She\\n\\n     will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.  I attempted to\\n\\n     reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current\\n\\n     recurrent infections.  It is more likely due to her cystocele.\\n\\n\\n\\n(4)  Peripheral vascular disease.  This appears stable.  She remains off the\\n\\n     cigarettes.  \\n\\n\\n\\n(5)  ASCVD.  She remains without symptoms.  \\n\\n\\n\\n(6)  GERD.  She remains on the Prilosec.\\n\\n\\n\\n(7)  Hyperlipidemia.  She remains on Lipitor.  She should have a repeat\\n\\n     cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n(8)  Borderline high sugar.  The patient should also have this rechecked with the\\n\\n     new physician in the fall.\\n\\n\\n\\nMary Isham, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\nMI/ussery/echols\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In addition, I personally\\n\\ninterviewed and examined this patient.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who\\n\\npresents for evaluation of chest pain.  The patient had no\\n\\nhistory of coronary artery disease until the last week.  She was\\n\\napparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week.  She\\n\\nhad been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort. \\n\\nShe considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums. \\n\\nAfter approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that the\\n\\ndiscomfort was not improving.  She did feel like that she had\\n\\nless energy for her usual activity.  She went to a hospital there\\n\\nin her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive\\n\\ntroponin.  She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did\\n\\nshow multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.  She subsequently\\n\\nunderwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.  She did\\n\\nhave recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which was\\n\\nmuch more severe, sharper in nature per her description.  She was\\n\\ntold in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.\\n\\n She returned home today, called her primary care physician and\\n\\nwas advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. \\n\\nShe does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvania\\n\\nearlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of more\\n\\nsevere left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhat\\n\\nmore sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencing\\n\\nbefore.  It is not always associated with exertion.  It sometimes\\n\\nradiates to her left shoulder.  It is not pleuritic in nature. \\n\\nIt seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low level\\n\\nof dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since her\\n\\ndischarge from Pennsylvania.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She\\n\\nis able to lie flat.  Denies any lower extremity edema.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for type 1 diabetes, which is\\n\\nfairly brittle per her report.  She is status post MI within the\\n\\nlast week.  She also has a remote history of PE in the past and\\n\\nis no longer on Coumadin.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She lives with her husband\\n\\nand has recently returned from Pennsylvania.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for CAD.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems are reviewed and are also\\n\\nnegative except per the HPI.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Include insulin, Plavix, aspirin, Nexium, Lipitor,\\n\\nand atenolol.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to iodine and Indocin.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 65,\\n\\nrespirations 18, and blood pressure 105/69.  The patient is\\n\\nawake, alert, pleasant female who is reclining in no acute\\n\\ndistress.  Her head examination is normocephalic and atraumatic. \\n\\nHer pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Her sclerae are\\n\\nanicteric.  Her conjunctivae are pink and moist.  She has moist\\n\\nmucous membranes and appears well hydrated.  Her neck is supple\\n\\nand nontender with full range of motion.  The JVP is not\\n\\nelevated.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with\\n\\nequal breath sounds, no respiratory distress.  No accessory\\n\\nmuscle use and no chest wall tenderness.  Her cardiac examination\\n\\nis regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Her\\n\\nabdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender.  No guarding, no\\n\\nperitoneal signs, and no organomegaly.  Her skin is intact, warm,\\n\\ndry, and slightly pale.  There are no rashes.  Her back is\\n\\nnontender with full range of motion.  Extremities reveal no\\n\\ncyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Her calves are soft and nontender\\n\\nwith no palpable cords and full range of motion with normal\\n\\nstrength and tone.  She is alert and oriented x3, very pleasant. \\n\\nCranial nerves are intact, and there is no motor or sensory\\n\\ndeficit.  Rectal examination performed by the resident reveals\\n\\nheme-negative stool with normal tone.\\n\\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was placed on a cardiac\\n\\nmonitor.  IV access was maintained.  Laboratory studies were sent\\n\\nand EKG was also ordered.  Her prior records from Pennsylvania were\\n\\nreviewed.  Her white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 37, and\\n\\nplatelets 285,000.  Her electrolytes are within normal limits. \\n\\nHer BUN is 18, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 112.  Her CK here\\n\\nreturned normal at 33.  Her MB was 0.4.  Her troponin returned\\n\\nelevated at 0.39.  This is in comparison to the troponin from her\\n\\nrecords of Pennsylvania, which was 0.2.  Her d-dimer is less than 200.\\n\\n Her INR is 1.1.  The patient had an EKG, which showed evidence\\n\\nof a new T-wave inversions, present on prior EKG from this\\n\\nhospital.

His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.  Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.  Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring \"rarely\", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol.  The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.\\n\\n\\n\\nPast medical history:\\n\\n   DMII, CAD, s/p CABG, VF Arrest Hypercholesterolemia, 1st Degree AV block, RBBB, NSVT\\n\\n\\n\\nMedications (Confirmed):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nDalmane 30 mg\\n\\nglyburide 2.5mg po qd\\n\\nLipitor 20 mg\\n\\nlisinopril 5 mg po qd\\n\\nmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg\\n\\nNexium 40mg po qd\\n\\n\\n\\nPhysical examination:\\n\\n-BP: 110/70  \\n\\n-Pulse: 50  \\n\\n-General:   No acute distress.\\n\\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\\n\\n-Heent:   Unremarkable\\n\\n-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits.

Mckenzie, M.D.\\nSan Luis Obispo County General Hospital\\n123 Pittsburg Street, Euite 598\\nBaxter Springs, MO  64715\\n\\nHISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.  He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking. He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  \\n\\nHe is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.  He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.  He has not had any rest pain.  For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.  He then had a left brachial artery.  Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.  There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.  With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.  He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.  He is married and lives in Missouri.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.  Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.  He had no jugular venous distention.  Chest was clear.  Heart had normal S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4.  There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.  His abdomen was benign.  Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.\\n\\nIMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.  His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.  We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.  We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.  We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nEdward L Echevarria, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\neScription document:1-0864568 SFFocus\\n\\n\\n\\nDD: 10/20/97\\nDT: 10/20/97\\nDV: 10/20/97\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day. Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made. STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur. REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities. Sinus bradycardia 56/min. First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test. Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited. SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study. Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%. \\n\\n\\n\\n5.

Pt was a smoker for 50 years occasionally uses Albuterol with a spacer suggested he use it pre op .  He had a stress test done in May 2094 and it was negative for ischemia and a LVEF was 50%.  Report in this note under Medical Problems.  He was admitted for \"chest pain \" in May 2094 and he no longer is using the NTG sl or the Nitropace.  He was told the \"pains\" he feels is most likely from his CABG ( CABG X3)- Grafts to RCA patent,occluded at circumflex, LIMA patent and the post sternal pain. The stress test was done during this admission as well as a CAT scan to r/o aortic dissection. ( also negative)  his biggest problem seems to be his \"not very well controlled diabetes\".  There is a note from the May 2094 admission that he was to receive a trial of Nexium to see if his \"chest pain\" was epigastric\" but pt and wife said he never received this medication.  He denies any GERD or \"chest pain\" since may 2094.  He recognizes his hypoglycemia sx\\'s and  also his hyper glycemia sx\\'s ( blurred vision) when his blood sugar is 480.

       " \"\\n\\nRecord date: 2094-03-14\\n\\n Youssef Null\\nLudlow Medical Center\\n82 Manatee Street\\nPost, IN 86454\\n\\nDear Dr. Null, \\n\\nI had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up of his recent admission to the ICMA.  While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records.  He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.  MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.  He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA.  After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.  Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.  His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.  He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.  He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.  \\n\\nRegarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.  Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.  \\n\\nHe has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes.  He feels well, and has had no problems.  He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea.  He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication.  He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's.  His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.  \\n\\nHis past medical history includes:\\n CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA\\n VF arrest in setting of STEMI\\n Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT\\n LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94\\n hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)\\n hypothyroid\\n basal cell skin CA\\n nephrolithiasis\\n\\nHis medications include:\\n Lipitor 80 mg\\n Plavix 75 mg\\n ASA 325 mg po QD\\n Lopressor 200 mg po BID\\n Prilosec 20 mg\\n\\nHe has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.\\n\\nHis family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.\\n\\nHe works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job.  He is now back at work.  He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.  He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.  He has never smoked cigarettes.  He drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam.\\n\\nOn physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75.  He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.  His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.  His abdomen is benign.  He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.\\n\\nHis EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.  He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.\\n\\nHis recent cardiac tests include: \\n - echo 2/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease\\n - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s/p Angiojet/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result \\n\\nIn summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA.  He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event.  Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.  Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.  Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.  His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.  I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.  We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.  \\n\\nGiven his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.  Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.  At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing.  \\n\\nIt was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.  I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.  \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\n_____________________________________________\\nFlorence Heather Gil, M.D., Ph.D.\\n\\nCC: Dr. Nick Golden\\n        Thoracic Surgery \\n        Wytheville South Hospital\\n\\n        Dr. Paul Reilly\\n        Riverside Family Practice Center\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.  However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.  This lasted for ~24 hours.  He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.  He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.

The \\npatient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and \\nwhose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for \\nwhich he suffered a \"silent heart attack\" many years ago, a history of \\nbenign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD.  As it \\nturns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the \\nbeneficial effects of which were unknown.  We had decided as of our last \\nmeeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.  The \\npatient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will \\ncontinue to discontinue this medicine.  At this point, the patient does \\nnot need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec.  \\nWith regard to the patient\\'s symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, \\nthe patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he \\nwanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago.  \\nThus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.  It is \\nnoted that his blood pressure was 152/74, which is better than it was \\nthe last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and \\ndiastolic was 80-90.  The patient reports no new symptomatology other \\nthan occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest.  The patient \\nhas no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no \\nankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are \\nremarkably normal, given his medical complaints.  The patient\\'s \\ncholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.  Review \\nof systems otherwise negative.\\n \\nPhysical exam is not performed at this time.  Blood pressure was 152/76 \\non the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 \\nand unlabored, and pulse was 70.\\n \\nASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical \\nproblems coming in for follow-up.\\n1.   Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use \\n     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic \\n     hypertrophy.  The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, \\n     and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while \\n     standing.  The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which \\n     hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic \\n     hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped.  If \\n     the patient\\'s symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to \\n     Urology for possible TUNA procedure.\\n \\n2.   BPH - please see above.  The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.\\n \\n3.   ? coronary artery disease - the patient\\'s cholesterol is 190 with a \\n     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable \\n     for this gentleman.  I do not have an HDL in which to judge his \\n     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s \\n     MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL\\nStephen A.N.

Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without \\n     therapy.  I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in \\n     about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he \\n     will be put on an antilipid drug.\\n \\n4.   GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I \\n     will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this \\n     point.  Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be \\n     placed on Prilosec.\\n \\nI will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of \\nhis use of Hytrin.\\n \\n \\n______________________________\\nStephen A.N.

She did not apply any pressure.  She states \\nthat she was bleeding through the night, did not want to bother her \\nbrother, called Dr. Aponte today who told her to come in.  She \\nstates that she did not know where the site was.  She could not see \\nit and she did not apply pressure.  She has no chest pain, no \\nshortness of breath.  She is not dizzy.  She is on Lovenox and \\nCoumadin both.  She has not had her PT checked.  The rest of the \\nsystems were reviewed and are negative. \\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression, cardiac cath, hypothyroidism. \\nMEDICATIONS:  Taken from the chart. \\nALLERGIES:  Taken from the chart. \\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her brother. \\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her heart rate was 81, her temperature is \\n96.5 degrees, blood pressure is 123/64.  This is a well-developed \\nfemale, alert, oriented.  HEENT exam is atraumatic, normocephalic. \\nNeck is soft and supple.  Mouth and throat are normal. \\nWell-hydrated moist mucosa.  Conjunctiva are clear.  Sclerae are \\nnon-icteric.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Heart had a \\nregular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to auscultation \\nbilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender.  No guarding.  No \\nhepatosplenomegaly.  There is a hematoma at the right groin.  The \\ncath site was about 1 cm and closed but there was some small oozing \\nfrom the site.  It stopped with pressure.  The patient was covered \\nin blood and blood clots.  The old dressing was removed.  All the \\ndried blood and blood clots were removed.  The patient was cleaned \\nup by myself.  Then, the nurses put her in the hospital gown. \\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  PT, PTT, CBC were obtained. \\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  After speaking with the patient at \\nlength, it seems that she lives with her older brother.  She is \\ncaring for him and is a bit overwhelmed with this.  Obviously, her \\nmedical knowledge base is not adequately prepared to deal with this \\nproblem.  She will be admitted to the Observation Area through the \\nday for nurse training.  Social Services will be consulted to \\narrange for a home visiting nurse.

Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration. However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration. Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.\\n\\n\\n\\nI took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies. Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment. For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.\\n\\n\\n\\nBobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks.

She has had three\\noperations on her back, finally ending with a fusion of\\nL2-L3 and a laminectomy in that area for recurrent disk\\ndisease  at L2-L3.  She still is having severe pain going\\ndown her right leg and anterior knee which is unchanged or\\nperhaps somewhat better.  She sees Dr. Herring with\\nregularity.  She has seen Dr. Oscar Riggs.  She has\\nnothing wrong with her hips and she has had multiple CT\\nscans showing the numerous operations and fusion.  \\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  \\n1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d. \\n2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d. \\n3.  Trandate 100 mg q.d.  \\n4.  Tegretol 300 mg in a.m., 200 mg in the p.m.  \\n5.  Premarin 0.625 mg 30 days a month.  \\n6.  Provera 5 mg 12 days a month.\\n7.  Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg q.d. \\n8.  Calcium 1200 mg q.d. \\n\\nShe is in physiotherapy presently. She is not smoking nor\\ndrinking.  She has been eating and has gained considerable\\nweight.\\n\\nShe has no cardiopulmonary, GI or GU complaints.  She is to\\nsee Dr. Bruce Godfrey's replacement in August and to get a\\nmammogram at that time.  Hopefully, she will be able to lie\\non the table when that occurs.  She is now able to drive a\\ncar, but walks with a cane and cannot lie down with any\\ndegree of ease.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She weighs 192 lbs stripped and her\\nblood pressure is 160/90 in the left arm standing, pulse is\\n72 and regular.  She appears as a well developed, overweight\\nwhite female in pain, having to hold on while standing,\\neasily weeping, but pleasant.  There is no icterus, cyanosis\\nor edema.  The eyes reveal 2+ arcus.  Pupils are round,\\nreactive and equal.  Nose and throat examination is\\nunremarkable.  Neck veins are flat.  Carotids are 2+ and\\nequal and without bruit.  Thyroid small and smooth.  Lungs\\nare clear to P&A. The heart is not enlarged.  There is a\\nregular sinus rhythm and no significant murmurs.  S1 and S2\\nare normal.  Liver and spleen cannot be felt.  She has good\\nperipheral pulses.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  \\n1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.  She has had an eye exam at\\nMitchel Memorial Hospital this past year, but her diabetes is poorly\\ncontrolled as her blood sugars have been in the 150-200\\nrange.  I have told her to increase her Glynase to 3 mg\\ntwice a day until she is able to diet.\\n2.  L2-L3 disk with fusion. \\n3.  Mild hypertension, on no medication.

By report, patient was sitting on the couch at his sister's house, slumped to the floor and had seizure activity x 45seconds that was witnessed by EMS sevices. Accu-checks done at that time were >500 and attempts at intubation were unsuccessful. He was transported to ER, where additional attempts to secure his airway were also unsuccessful, by 2 physicians. There appeared to be some sot of stricture in the upper airway (not obvious on CT scan). However, pt had witnessed emesis, and was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask, with Versed and propofol for sedation with adequate O2 saturation. A x-ray confirmed dependent lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia, and pt was started on Clindamycin.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn arrival to the ER, patient was also found to have a blood pressure of 248/146. He received 50mg dose of labetolol in the ER as well as several additional doses in the ICU. In the ICU, patient did not have any further witnessed seizure activity. A Head CT demonstrated no focal lesion, IC hemorrhage or other abnormality. Pt was treated with dilantin and IV insulin infusion. Serum ketones were negative. Additional workup revealed LVH by EKG criteria, as well as renal insufficiency Cr 2.6. Urine tox was positive for benzos, but was otherwise negative.\\n\\n\\n\\nPatient also developed leukoytosis (WBC ?) with temp of 102 degrees. Although he had minimal neck stiffness by neurology consult exam, he underwent a lumbar puncture that demonstrated a colorless clear fluid, with glucose of 108, TP 44. Grams stain was negative. Tube #4 contained 21RBCs and 7 WBCs with a diff of 96% PMNs and 4% lymphs. CSF cultures and blood cultures were also done, and are pending.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring his hospital course, patient maintained adequate oxygenation with nasal trumpet in place. ABG on 08/25/61 am was 7.36/PCO2 45/ PO2 366, with bicarb of 25 and 100% sats. His FIO2 was subsequently weaned. He remained hemodynamically stable with BP 184/88 (MAP 114) HR100, RR23, 97% on cannula. Cardiac enzymes were negative.

Concern for hypertensive encephalopathy. Pt had LP at outside hospital which did not suggest meningitis. Other possibilities include infarct, encephalitis. Neurology consulted, with recommendations for:\\n\\nn\\tEEG \\n\\nn\\tMRI w/ susceptibility  to evaluate for posterior leukoencephalopathy, MRA head/neck, MRV brain\\n\\nn Dilantin (continued from OSH)\\n\\nn\\tCheck tox screen, ammonia. Mother has brought in some unknown pills which we will try to identify.\\n\\n2.\\tID - increased WBC, low grade temp s/p LP. No bacterial source for now, but CXR with opacities suspicious for pneumonia. Will start Vancomycin and cefepime empirically, and narrow per culture results. Concern for encephalitis, as HSV can present w/ HTN and seizures. Will ask Linden Health to add HSV PCR to CSF taken from LP prior to transfer. Start Acyclovir empirically in interim.\\n\\n3.\\tResp - s/p multiple attempted intubations at OSH, currently breathing adequately on RA, with audible obstructive physiology. Given need for MRI, may have to sedate and intubate. Will call anesthesia. Continue intubated until MS more alert, for airway protection. Will start ARDSnet for criteria meeting low PaO2/FIO2 ratio and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.\\n\\n4.\\tCV- severe hypertension w/ evidence of potential end organ damage (kidney/brain/cardiac). Will control BP w/ Nipride drip, with addition of labetalol for HR control. Target goal 25% decrease to SPB~160 today, and SBP 120 the following day. Check CK/TPNs. Continue IVF for potential rhabdo.\\n\\n5.\\tRenal - Renal failure w/ Cr 2.6, unclear baseline. Suspect acute on chronic component given DM w/ poor follow-up. Will check Urine sediment, lytes to evaluate. Reading by me is +hyaline/waxy casts but no WBC or RBC casts. Kidney U/S pending, also with Doppler to evaluate for RAS. Also check urine renin/aldo and 24hr metanephrine for pheochromocytoma, serum metanephrine, and 24hr protein for nephritic syndrome in presence of HTN and hematuria.\\n\\n6.\\tEndo - tight glucose control; CZI drip for DM. Has gap but No ketones at OSH; did not arrive in DKA. Will need reg insulin after drip DC'd in future.\\n\\n7.\\tAccess - PIV\\n\\n8.\\tProphylaxis - nexium, heparin SQ, peridex, HOB 30.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInfant Ledford\\n\\n#12182\\n\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p CT-guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on 7/07 and by IR 7/22, both sites positive for MSSA.  Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p ex-lap 6/22, gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection, splenectomy and primary anastamosis, with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.  He also had VRE/klebsiella LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage.  \\n\\nHe was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.  So he was switched to vanco/ambisome/linezolid/meropenem/amikacin for LUQ abscess.  After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons \"scooped out\" as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions. \\nGiven the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge\\'s GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.  This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.  He was started on this drug on 8/28/62 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea, diarrhea.  \\n\\nHe has been at EDUCARE-FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.  He walks with a walker.  He had repeat CT abd/pelvix 10/26 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection.  He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain, without much output.  He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition, despite po intake.  He has been trying to eat, but reports some nausea and diarrhea, especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole.  He reports good glycemic control.

The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as \\nplanned.  She states that she has been \"too busy.\"  Her only complaint \\ntoday is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is \\nrelieved to some extent by acetaminophen.  \\n \\nEva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.  A noted in her \\nambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug, however, \\nEva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than \\non an almost p.r.n. basis.  \\n \\nReview of systems is essentially normal.  Specifically, she denies any \\nheadaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.  She also denies any \\nsymptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.  She has no history of \\ndysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.\\n \\nPhysical Examination:  She is robust appearing.  Vital signs are \\nsignificant for a blood pressure of 140/100.  HEENT exam is unremarkable.  \\nLungs are clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal \\nS1, S2.  No S3 is appreciated.  There are no murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen is \\nslightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.  No masses are \\nappreciated.  Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not \\nsuggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.  Indeed, exam of \\nher legs is entirely unremarkable.  \\n \\nLaboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine \\nsediment and a urine creatinine.\\n \\nAssessment and Plan:\\n \\n1.   Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure \\n     on her Procardia.  I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which \\n     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, \\n     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.  I will see her in a few days in order \\n     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug \\n     and also to check her blood pressure once again.\\n \\n2.   Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be \\n     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the \\n     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)  I  have asked her to continue taking \\n     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, \\n     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.\\nPROMPTCARE INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Rutledge, Eva\\nPage 2                                        29195561\\n                                              6-19-59\\n \\n \\n \\n3.   Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal \\n     appointment.  In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I \\n     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.  \\n     She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have \\n     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.  \\n     Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this \\n     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney \\n     function.  \\n \\n4.   Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear \\n     today, but again was \"too busy to stay that long.\"  She is to see me \\n     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.  Her \\n     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and \\n     will not be repeated until next year.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n_________________________\\nUlysses Quijano, M.D.\\n \\nTD:PX:4740\\nDD:6-20-59\\nDT:6-19-59\\nDV:6-19-59\\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired Electrician\\nat Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent\\nhealth until the past year. He denies any prior history of\\nhypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significant\\nchildhood illnesses or malignancy. He describes his usual baseline\\nhealth as excellent. He is a religious walker, walking multiple\\ntimes each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast. Dr.\\nRodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he\\nwas first diagnosed with hyperglycemia. This was treated with\\nMetformin. Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added\\napparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe\\nhe has been diagnosed with hypertension). He subsequently developed\\ndiarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was\\nsubsequently reduced in dose. In June of the past year the patient\\nwas noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his\\nHydrochlorothiazide. At that time he also was found to have lower\\nextremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the\\nHydrochlorothiazide. The patient states in September of 2119 he\\ntraveled to trinidad and tobago. While in trinidad and tobago he had a\\nmarked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he\\nfound it difficult to ambulate. He denied any difficulty with chest\\npains or shortness of breath. He had no hemoptysis and no focal\\nunilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility\\nduring the trip. He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an\\nethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema\\nsignificantly. However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this\\nmedication and it was stopped. Subsequently his lower extremity has\\nonce again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of\\nLasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn. At the present\\ntime Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath. He\\nstill able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any \\n\\nPage 2\\nFreeman Faust, M.D. \\nRE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. \\nJanuary 18, 2120\\n\\n\\nlimitation. He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling\\nin his lower extremities. He has no chest pain, has no cough, no\\nsputum production, no hemoptysis. He has no fevers or chills. He\\nbelieves his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several\\nmonths. He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation. He\\ndenies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note\\nthat he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is\\noften napping in the reclining chair which is new for him. He\\ndenies any history of snoring. He has noted no new joint complaints\\nalthough he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of\\nhis right lower extremity as well as on his left arm. This has been\\npresent for approximately two or three months. Other than that he\\nbelieves his bowel and bladder function is normal. Review of\\nsystems is otherwise unremarkable. \\n\\nHis past medical history is significant for:\\n     1. Type II diabetes as above. \\n     2. An apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his \\n        chart. \\n     3. Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide. \\n     4. Past history of right bundle branch block. He has no      \\n        history of rheumatic fever. \\n\\nCurrent medications include Atenolol 25mg daily, folic acid,\\nGlucophage 850mg bid, Lasix 120mg daily, Lisinopril 15mg daily,\\ncompression stockings, Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently. \\n\\nDrug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to\\nHydrochlorothiazide. \\n\\nFamily history is significant for diabetes mellitus. \\n\\nSocial history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an\\nimmigrant from trinidad and tobago. He has been living in Haleyville\\nsince the early 2059's. He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo. He\\nhas minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his\\nbachelor's degree but none since then. He is a non tobacco user. He\\nuses alcohol minimally. He's never had any blood transfusions. He\\nlives with his wife. They have no pets. He does not enjoy any\\nunusual hobbies not noted above. He has been exposed to\\ntuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD. \\n\\nOn physical examination today Dr. Rodriquez weighs 193 pounds. Blood\\npressure is 136/90. Pulse 83 and regular. Respiratory rate is 20.\\nTemperature is 96.8. Resting oxygen saturation is 98-99% with\\nambulation in the hallway. This fell to a minimum of 97% with an\\nincrease in his heart rate to 100. HEENT exam is significant for a\\nclear oropharynx. Sclera are white. Conjunctiva are minimally pale.\\nPage 3\\nFreeman Faust, M.D. \\nRE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. \\nJanuary 18, 2120\\n\\n\\nThe thyroid gland is normal. Jugular venous distention to\\napproximately 10 cm. was noted. Neck was supple. Examination of the\\nchest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness\\nat both bases. There was no egophony and no wheezes. Otherwise the\\nlungs were clear. Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,\\nnormal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated. No RV heave\\nor lift was appreciated. No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.\\nThe pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced. No appreciable\\nmurmurs were detected. The point of maximum impulse was in the\\nanterior axillary line. Examination of the abdomen revealed a\\nnontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths\\nbelow the right costal margin. This was nontender and smooth.\\nMinimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well. Normal bowel\\nsounds were present. Examination of the extremities reveal three\\nplus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower\\nextremities, one plus edema was also present in both upper\\nextremities. No clubbing was noted. There were no skin changes\\nconsistent with collagen vascular disease. Multiple follicular\\nlesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as\\nwell as on the left arm. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. \\n\\nObjective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a\\nwhite count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250.\\nDifferential was not remarkable. LVH is elevated at 599, AST is\\nmost recently 22. A urinalysis on 12/07/19 was negative for\\nprotein. No reportive cast was made. A CEA was notable for a level\\nof 2.4 on 1/05/20. An echocardiogram obtained on 12/22/19\\ndemonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved\\nLV function. The right ventricle was mildly dilated and\\nhypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function. There was trace\\nMR with moderate TR. A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus\\nright atrial pressure was noted. \\n\\nIn summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut\\npulmonary hypertension. The etiology of this is not clear at the\\nmoment. Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic\\ndisease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive\\nsleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease. In addition some\\npatients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the\\nsetting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left\\nventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of\\nexclusion. The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree\\nwith increasing his diuretic regimen. I'm embarking on a course of\\nevaluation to exclude the most likely causes. In specific he will\\nbe having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic\\ndisease this afternoon. This has already been arranged by Dr.\\nFaust. In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an\\nantidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70. I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez\\nPage 4\\nFreeman Faust, M.D. \\nRE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. \\nJanuary 18, 2120\\n\\n\\nto undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea. He\\nwill be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal\\npulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an\\narterial blood gas drawn. If this evaluation should be unrevealing,\\nhe may require more invasive diagnostics. I've already consulted\\nformally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most\\nexperience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would\\nbe able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our\\nworkup is nondiagnostic.  \\n\\nDr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.\\nI'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after\\nhis diagnostic tests have been performed. Please do not hesitate to\\ncall me with any further questions or concerns. \\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJose Church, M.D.\\n\\n/ray\\n\\nDD: 01/18/20\\nDT: 01/19/:0\\nDV: 01/18/20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

He was diagnosed with progressive shortness of breath in 2078.  He was treated with diuretics and other medications at that time.  He did quite well until December of last year when he had a cardiac arrest and underwent ICD placement.  He has had worsening symptoms over the last year with increasing shortness of breath on flat ground and a very severe shortness of breath with stairs.  He has had some episodic nature to this.  Two days prior to admission, he had relatively rapid onset of shortness of breath while trying to play pool.  This recurred several times associated with diaphoresis.  He had no palpitations at that time.  He has no chest discomfort.\\n\\nHis past medical history is significant for history of shower emboli and TIA in 2081.  He has diabetes.  He had spinal stenosis surgery in 2078.\\n\\nHis current medical regimen is Bumex 3, recently decreased from 12 due to worsening renal function.  He is on spironolactone described as 6.25 daily, digoxin 0.125, Toprol-XL 12.5.  He has been on carvedilol, which was changed due to dizziness.  He is on lisinopril 1.25 mg and has had great difficulty tolerating any higher dose due to dizziness.  He is on metolazone 2.5 weekly.  He takes Coumadin 7.5 mg most days.  He is on insulin and Lantus.  He has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nHis family history is essentially unremarkable.  Mother unknown, father had onset of angina in his 80s.  The patient lives with his wife and son and is a retired Fire Chief.  He had an 80-pack-year smoking history but quit four years ago.  He has one glass of alcohol every 1-2 weeks.\\n\\nReview of systems is negative for any problems with fevers, chills, change in his bowel or bladder habits.  He has no problems with swallowing.  He has no problems with hearing or vision.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.\\n\\nOn physical examination, blood pressure is 84/66 in the left arm and 86/62 in the right arm.  His chest is completely clear to auscultation and percussion.  Temperature is 35.9.  His heart rate is 100 and a regular rhythm.  His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave, which is visible.  He has a palpable and audible third heart sound.  The right ventricular impulse is present also.  He has a systolic murmur, which is heard everywhere, not otherwise easy to characterize.  It does not change with respiration.  The second component of the second sound is slightly increased in radiation consistent with a PA systolic pressure in the range of 50-60.  His legs are cool.  Venous pattern is very prominent.  His pulses are intact peripherally.  He has no abdominal bruits.  His jugular venous pressure is 14 cm.  He has no cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly.  His liver percusses at approximately 5 cm below the costal margin.  He has some increased resonance around the umbilicus.  Laterally, there is suggestion of some fluid in the distention.  There is no peripheral edema.  His joints are without obvious deformities, although he describes arthritis in his shoulder, neck, and back.  He has no skin rashes or sores, several very small ecchymoses.  His standing blood pressure is unchanged.  He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 98.\\n\\nASSESSMENT:\\n1.  Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined.  We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography.  The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.  He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.  However, the episodicity is significant.\\n2.  Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern.  His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.  However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected.  It is also possible that this is related to angina.\\n3.  Other related risks.  He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.  It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.\\n\\nThere are no obvious contraindications to transplant.  At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation.  Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion.  We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPatricia Cameron Izzo, MD\\nCardiac Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\neScription document:2-7203595 SFFocus\\n\\n\\n\\nDD: 10/07/83\\nDT: 10/07/83\\nDV: 10/06/83\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

She subsequently underwent a mediastinoscopy in April of this year for bulky adenopathy which the pathology was also consistent with sarcoidosis.  She present for evaluation of abdominal pain that has been present for months but became unbearable prompting a visit to the emergency room.  Mrs. Haynes reports that over the past few months she has been experiencing weight loss, early satiety, night sweats and fatigue.  He abdominal pain is described as a sharp to achy pain that started in her right side, progressed to her epigastric and suprapubic are and then her left side.  Currently it is diffuse associated with nausea and vomiting.  She denies bowel problems has had some difficulty with urination and some frequency since admission but this is generally not a problem.  ROS is also pertinet for HA which are chronic and palpations both of which are hard to describe.\\n \\nROS: In detail otherwise unremarkable.\\n\\n\\nPast Medical History:  \\n\\nHTN, Hyperlipidemia (h/o normal stress test in past), palpitations, GERD, thyroid nodules, lichen sclerosis, bilateral adrenal adenomas, diabetes mellitus type II, sarcoidosis\\n\\n\\nPast Surgical History:  \\n s/p uterine fibroid resection 2096, s/p left facial biopsy 10/01\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nMedications (current):  \\n \\n\\nCiprofloxacin 500 mg q 12 hr\\nLovenox 40 mg SC day\\nLisinopril 40 mg Po day\\nSimvastatin 40 mg QHS\\nNifedipine 60 mg Po day\\nOmeprazole 40 mg Po day\\nNPH/Insulin Aspart\\nMag Sulfate\\nCA Carbonate\\nColace\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllergies:              sulfa causes GI intolerance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily History:   Sister x 2 w/MI, Sister w/DM type II, Niece w/DM type II, Brother w/prostate CA, Brother w/possible leukemia, Mother w CVA. No Hx of sarcoid or TB in the family.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial History:  The patient is a lifelong nonsmoker with a 20 year exposure to secondhand smoke.  The patient has no known asbestos exposure.  The patient is widowed with four children and is retired from her former job at Lowe\\'s.  She was born in Georgia moved to Chelsea in the 50\\'s and the only place she has visited was Augusta.  No TB exposures or risk factors.  States she had been tested for TB in the past years ago.

Findings consistent with infection versus less likely     inflammation.     2. Bladder calculus.     3. Abdominal lymphadenopathy, increased since prior study, may be     consistent with progression of known sarcoid, versus malignancy.     4. Adrenal nodules, unchanged.\\n \\nCT Chest 3/16\\n \\nIMPRESSION:     1. Mediastinal, bilateral hilar, supraclavicular,     retroperitoneal, and gastrohepatic adenopathy likely represents     lymphoma rather than sarcoidosis given the patient age and     abdominal involvement.     2. Bilateral adrenal nodules.\\n \\nPath: 04/10/2102 PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED \"4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY\" (including FSA):     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE).B. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED \"4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY\":     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE).\\n\\n\\nImpression:  Mrs. Haynes is a pleasant 67 yo female with biopsy demonstrating non-caesating granululoma in a left eye nodule and mediastinal lymph nodes.  Cx data was not obtained.  However, hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors.  Clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis.  At this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids.  At this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and Dr. Villalpando.\\n\\n\\nRecommendations:  \\n \\n-Would consider Cardiac MRI given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment.\\n-Would recommend checking PPD\\n-Would recommend starting prednisone 30mg po qday.  Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow.  There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr. Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs. Haynes.\\n-Would also recommend Bactrim prophylaxis while she is on greater than 15 mg Po prednisone.  1 DS M/W/F.\\n-Will follow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for this interesting consult.

He has been very compliant with his \\nmedication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and NPH \\ninsulin subQ q.AM.  He has had 2 episodes of sweating, but he did not \\ncheck his blood sugar at the time.  He has not had any frank \\npalpitations or lightheadedness.  He did have 1 episode where he had the \\nsensation of several extra heart beats.  This was not accompanied by \\nother symptoms including no chest pain.  He has never had a fingerstick \\nblood glucose below the mid 150's.  I am looking through his log and see \\nthat his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before \\ndinner they have been between 157-296.  He has already met several times \\nwith Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his \\ntherapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a \\ndiabetic diet.  \\n \\nOn physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood \\npressure is 132/78 in the right arm sitting.\\n \\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars. I will increase his \\ninsulin regimen.  He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his \\nnew regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units \\nbefore bedtime.  And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and \\nI have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as \\nsyringes and needles, #60, refills 3.  He is to follow up with me in \\nseveral months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns.  I have \\nadvised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining \\nhis diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any \\nsymptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading \\nat that time as well.  \\n \\n \\n \\n_________________________\\nXaiden Roberson, M.D.                                                   \\n \\nPZ:WX:4138                                                              \\nDD:12-21-88                                                             \\nDT:12-23-88                                                             \\nDV:12-21-88                                                             \\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Provider ********\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

She notes that she is still having occasional sweats at \\nnight. She is using the clonidine but she can't take it two times a day, \\nit makes her too sleepy, so she takes it about 3:30 towards the end of \\nher workday and then again before she goes to bed. She is having some \\nright lower back pain and otherwise is feeling well.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except as noted. She is also taking the \\nCozaar which she had been taking before. \\n\\nShe was called back in today as a result of labs which were done \\nrecently which showed hemoglobin A1C of 8.7, an elevated urine \\nmicroalbuminuria and hypertension which needed follow up.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam today, she is well developed and well \\nnourished in no acute distress. Blood pressure 158/116, pulse 80, weight \\n166. Pupils are equal and equally reactive to light. Lids and \\nconjunctiva normal. Retinal fields normal. Disks sharp. Mouth and \\npharynx without erythema or exudate. No adenopathy or tenderness in the \\nsubmandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas. \\nHeart sounds: S1, S2, with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the \\nright sternal border. No rub or gallop. Her chest was clear to \\nauscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or \\nrhonchi. She was clear to percussion. She has normal bowel sounds. Her \\nabdomen was soft and nontender, no mass, organomegaly, and no guarding, \\nno rebound. Her extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing. She \\nhas no spine or flank tenderness. Her neck is supple, no bruits. Her \\nskin is essentially quite dry and itchy. She has multiple dark, \\nhyperpigmented, post-inflammatory scarring on her lower extremities. Her \\nmouth and pharynx are without erythema or exudate. \\n\\nIMPRESSION/PLAN:\\n1. Hypertension. Her blood pressure is really not well controlled. I \\nwill add atenolol to her regimen 50mg PO q.d. She drinks one cup of \\ncoffee a day and rarely has alcohol although she notes that she will \\noccasionally have one, a scotch, on Friday or Saturday. She does not do \\ndrugs. She will return in three week for follow up of her blood \\npressure and at that time for a physical exam for which she will be due. \\n\\n2. Diabetes. The patient had been told in the past that she had diabetes \\nbut she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it. Her \\ncreatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her \\nelevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment. We will start her on \\nGlucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. I expect we will need to increase this and if \\nshe tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week. \\nI also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat \\nor if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication. I suggested \\nshe actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is \\neating. I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry.

She states that her pain started about three weeks ago when she was bending and picking up a pot. She states she had a pain in her back that radiated around her right side down her groin into her medial leg, not past the knee. She states that it went away at that time. The next day she felt worsened and had difficulty working and saw her physician.  An MRI was ordered. Since then, she feels about 60-75 percent better. She states that her pain is constant and describes it as a sharp pain. She does state she feels weak and her knee would buckle. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She states she uses a walker to get to her bathroom, however, otherwise stays in the recliner. Her symptoms are increased with lying down and standing and decreased with sitting.  \\n\\n \\n\\nTherapeutically, she has not received any physical therapy or occupational therapy. She is currently taking Darvocet, however, less frequently, and Celebrex for arthritis. Diagnostically, she has had an MRI scan in April 2092 that showed multi-level spinal stenosis, most prominent at L3/L4, especially on the right side, secondary to facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum infolding, as well as possibly a mild disk bulge. Her mammogram was done in 2091 which was okay. She has not had a bone mineral density at this time.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMEDICATIONS: Currently, the medication she is on is Celebrex, Hyzaar for her blood pressure, and Darvocet for her pain.   \\n\\nALLERGIES: She states that taking Tylenol With Codeine gives her toes a burning sensation, and ibuprofen causes tinnitus.   \\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has got high blood pressure and shoulder arthritis.  \\n\\n \\n\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had a left breast biopsy which she states was not cancerous.  \\n\\n \\n\\nSOCIAL/FUNCTIONAL HISTORY: She is functionally currently not working. She is taking sick time. She has not worked for the past three weeks. She is a Head Nurse and worked at The Library Corporation for the last 35 years. She states her job is medium as far as intensity of work. Functionally, her activities of daily living are limited, and she uses an assistive device.  \\n\\n \\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and she has four healthy children, ages 51, 50, 48, and 46. She does not smoke or drink.   \\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: She has aunts with diabetes and brother that had an myocardial infarction at 59.  \\n\\n \\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, no fevers, chills, recent infections, bladder, thyroid problems, rash, shortness of breath, palpations, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bowel or bladder or sexual problems or urination difficulty.  She does have some joint pain and swelling in her shoulders and her feet occasionally. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She does have some trouble walking secondary to the pain. She does not feel fatigued and her appetite is okay and she does not feel anxious or stressed. She does have some mild trouble with sleeping, however, this has improved over the last few days.  \\n\\n \\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, well-developed, well-nourished, well-groomed, normal mood and affect, but slightly anxious with movement, female in no acute distress at this time. On musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine, flexion was within normal limits. Extension she had her type of pain at about 10-20 degrees. Side-bending was unremarkable. On hip examination she had some decreased internal rotation on the right when compared to the left. Straight leg raise bilaterally was negative, however, supine, slight guarding on the right.  Femoral stretch was positive on the right but not on the left. On neurological examination, as far as motor examination, there is some slight decrease, half a grade, quadriceps and hip flexors; however, this was functional; otherwise unremarkable on the right or the left. Her reflexes were 2 plus in the achilles. Babinskis were downgoing, 1 plus at the patella on the right, and 2 plus on the left. Sensory examination slightly decreased at L3 on the right; however, normal throughout; otherwise, gait was antalgic on the right and she did not want to bear weight.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIMPRESSION:  \\n\\n1. Right L3 acute radiculopathy secondary to herniated disk and facet arthropathy.  \\n\\n2. Functional limitations secondary to pain, causing her functional weakness.  \\n\\n \\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  \\n\\n1. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L3 and L4 on the right.  \\n\\n2. Physical therapy after her injection.  \\n\\n3. Continue her medications of Darvocet and Celebrex.  4. Keep her out of work until she is able to receive the injection, as well as continue with her physical therapy to improve her strength, given her acute radiculopathy.   \\n\\nThe patient was seen and examined with Dr. Xayasane, who agrees with the plan above.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n_______________________________ \\n\\nEdward Xayasane, M.D.  \\n\\ncc: David Utterback, M.D.  \\n\\nDD:05/06/2092 \\n\\nDT:05/09/2092 \\n\\nTL:95468     :423 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.  In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.  There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.  This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.  The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.  She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.\\n\\nThe second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.\\n\\nShe was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.  The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.  Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.  Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.  There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.\\n\\nOn examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.  MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.  The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.  MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.  Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.\\n\\nCurrently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.  It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.  Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.  Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.  There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.  The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.  There are no medication allergies reported.\\n\\nPAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.\\n\\nNot withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.  She uses alcohol occasionally.  She has a 12th grade education.  She lives alone and is a widow.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.  The patient is overweight.  Height is 5 foot 3 inches.  Weight is 217 pounds.  Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.  Poor neck posture is noted.  Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.  Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Temporal arteries are normal.  Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.  Romberg is negative.  Tandem gait is normal.  The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.  There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.  This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.  There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.\\n\\nNEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.  Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.  Extraocular movements are full.  Visual fields are intact.  There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.  Visual fields are intact.  Hearing is intact.  Oropharynx is normal.  Palate elevates well.  Tongue is midline.  Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.  Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.  There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.  Coordination testing today seemed intact.\\n\\nPrior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.  Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.  Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.  Comment.  I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.  I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.  Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.  In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.  It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.\\n\\nPLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.  She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.  We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.  We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.  It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.  For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.  I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.  She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.  We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nRobert F Titus, MD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\neScription document:0-9416184 IL\\n\\n\\n\\nDD: 04/11/43\\nDT: 04/11/43\\nDV: 04/03/43\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The paramedics and police were called the scene. \\nThe police were able to force open the door of the home.  The \\npatient was found unconscious on the floor, having a generalized \\ntonic clonic seizure.  The patient was intubated and given 4 mg of \\nAtivan prior to arrival in the Emergency Department with the \\nparamedics.  On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient \\nwas noted to be comatose, intubated, and clearly in acute distress. \\nThe patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.  She has had a \\nseizure in the past, apparently secondary to hypoglycemia.  She \\nalso has a history of high blood pressure.  She is on diltiazem, \\nlisinopril, and medications for hypercholesterolemia. \\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 100.6 degrees F., her \\npulse 150, her respiratory rate 12, her blood pressure on arrival \\n205/90, and her O2 saturation is 98%.  On physical examination, the \\nHEENT examination reveals a normocephalic head with no evidence of \\ntrauma on examination.  The pupils are equal and round, weakly \\nreactive to light.  The pupils are 2 mm.  The fundi cannot be \\nvisualized.  The neck is supple.  There are no step-offs noted. \\nThe chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart has \\nnormal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmur.  The abdomen is \\nprotuberant, but soft and non-tender, without guarding, rebound, \\nmasses, or organomegaly.  The extremities are grossly within normal \\nlimits.  Grossly, there is no posturing; there are no Babinskis; \\nthe reflexes are about 1+ bilaterally. \\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  The head CT is noted to be negative.  The \\nEKG reveals ST elevations in III and possibly aVF.  The heart rate \\nis approximately 130.  The chest x-ray shows proper tube placement. \\nThe troponin I is 2.2, and is in the process of being repeated. \\nThe glucose is 174, the BUN 57, the creatinine 5.8, the sodium 137, \\nthe potassium 5.3, the chloride 101, the CO2 18.  The CK is noted \\nto be 920, and the CK-MB is 2.6%.  The toxicology screen is \\nnegative.  The troponin I again is 2.2.  The urine toxicology is \\nalso noted to be negative.  The white count is 14, the hemoglobin \\n11, the hematocrit 36, and the platelet count 350.  The urinalysis \\nshows 3+ blood.  There are only 1-3 WBCs in the urine. \\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:   The plan is to admit the patient \\nto the Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and evaluation.  An \\nLP will be done in the Emergency Department, and following the LP, \\nthe patient will be sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. \\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  The diagnostic impression in the Emergency \\nDepartment is seizure and coma of undetermined etiology. \\nDISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  The patient will \\nbe admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following her lumbar \\npuncture. \\n___________________________________                    HB768/1408 \\nH.

She has been to the emergency room\\nmultiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.  She has\\nbeen given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and\\ndicloxacillin.  She is planning to have her disease surgically\\nmanaged in the next few months.  She most recently presented to\\nthe emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage\\nof her hydradenitis in her groin.  She was given a prescription\\nof Keflex.  Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed\\nitching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives.  She\\ndenied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of\\nconsciousness.  She called the emergency room and was instructed\\nto stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic\\nreaction.  So now, she is here for follow up from that.  She said\\nshortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and\\nitchiness have improved very quickly.  She is still complaining\\nof purulent drainage around her groin.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.  She\\ngets hives from both.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.  Her bilateral\\ngroins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some\\npurulent drainage.  There is no fluctuance that I could feel.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.  Given the\\nrecent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a\\ndifferent antibiotic.  She has been on dicloxacillin in the past\\nwith good result.  Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin\\ncompared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for\\nnow.  If this does not work, I think one should consider\\nclindamycin for treatment.  I will go ahead and give her 14 days\\nworth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D. if\\nshe develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.  I also gave\\nher 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her\\nprescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day.  She should see her\\nPCP in two weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nByron Pham, M.D.\\n\\n\\nDictated By: Byron Pham\\n\\n\\neScription document:9-3042267 EMSSten Tel\\n\\n\\n\\nDD: 01/14/79\\nDT: 01/15/79\\nDV: 01/14/79\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The patient has persistent presence of bacteria in his urine and there is a concern that he might have a persistent source of infection.  The patient denies fevers, chills, sweats, decrease in energy, loss of appetite, pain in the lower abdomen or penile discharge.  He reports there is some soreness around the meatus, which he attributes to self-catheterizing he is required to do 3 times a day.  He is well educated in terms of cleaning around the side and the appropriate way to do self-catheterization.   \\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, paraplegia secondary to unclear disk problems in 2107, right hip ulcer with trochanteric osteomyelitis in December 2118, treated with Unasyn x6 weeks and debridement and surgical flap, sacral decubiti in 2119 treated with Unasyn x6 weeks, local debridement healing by secondary intention.  No history of kidney stones.   \\nSOCIAL:  Ex-tobacco use 2-3 packs per day, quit 25 years. Alcohol prior heavy use, quit 25 years.  Lives alone.  Prior work included Heavy-Duty Equipment Mechanic, Ironworker, as well as Electric Appliance Servicer.  \\n \\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  \\n \\nMEDICATIONS:  Blood pressure medication, name unknown. Metformin.  Note, patient had been on Bactrim prophylaxis over the spring.   \\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 150/100, heart rate 100, temperature 97.9.  In general, vigorous, well-appearing man in wheelchair.  Awake and alert.  HEENT, sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Neck supple.  No significant lymphadenopathy.  Chest, clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen benign.  Extremities, warm and well perfused.  No edema.  \\n \\nIMPRESSION:  Presence of bacteria in static urine within the bladder is not necessarily diagnostic as infection given patient's lack of symptoms and likely reflects colonization.   \\nPLAN:  Would not treat patient with antibiotics unless he develops signs or symptoms of infection such as fevers, chills, sweats, elevated white blood cell count, pain in the suprapubic area or decreased energy.  \\n \\n_________________________ \\nRosita Ko, M.D.  \\n \\nDD:10/23/2120 \\nDT:10/24/2120 \\nAO:29724     :0269\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

As you recall he is a 71-year-old gentleman who is\\nstatus post angioplasty on the left for high-grade stenotic\\nlesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the\\npopliteal artery on the left.  The patient presents now for\\nfurther evaluation of his \"claudication symptoms\".\\n\\nThe patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms,\\nthere are about equivalent in nature.  He has very minimal low\\nback pain.  He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to\\nbe associated with some abnormal gait.  He states on a bad day\\nits about a 9/10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as\\nhigh as 8-9/10.  The episodes are almost daily and are brought on\\nby things like walking.  He can walk less than one block at which\\npoint he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow\\nshuffling and occasionally falling.  When he is having severe\\nsymptoms he notes his legs to be weak.  He denies any bowel or\\nbladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic\\nUTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He has very\\nlittle back pain associated with his symptomatology.  He has had\\nno physical therapy to date and no spinal injections.  He\\ndescribes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he\\nstates it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension.\\n Years ago he stated he was in excellent health.  His weight is\\nsteady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss.  He\\ndoesn\\'t smoke and drinks socially.  Quit smoking 33 years ago. \\nHe does not think he will ever be pain free.\\n\\nReview of Systems:  Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic\\nand he has been for the past couple of years.  He has difficulty\\nwith sleep.  He has a balance problem and also has benign\\nprostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection,\\nfor this he takes Cardura.  He has a history of high blood\\npressure.  Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality.  No\\nrespiratory malfunction.  He has had surgery for something \"in\\nhis colon\" he has also had a bypass surgery.  He is on Plavix and\\naspirin.\\n\\nPhysical Examination:  Shows that he is solid built, healthy\\nappearing male.  He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left\\nside his T band seems to be slightly weak.  Single toe raises\\nshow that the right leg is stronger than the left leg.  He has no\\ntenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs.  He has\\nnegative Trendelenburg bilaterally.  Forward flexion allows him\\nto get to the patella.  Extension is pain free and passive\\nhyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms.\\n\\nMotor testing is normal in his lower extremities.  Sensory is\\nsymmetric.  He has negative straight leg raises.  He has no\\npalpable pulses.  He is hairless in his lower extremities.  He\\nhad no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman\\'s suggesting\\nthat he is not myelopathic despite his \"balance abnormality\".\\n\\nHe is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes,\\nand for his gastroesophageal reflux.\\n\\nPersonal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating\\nwith, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in\\nhis iliac artery on the right.  CT scan shows lumbosacral facet\\nhypertrophy.\\n\\nAt this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative\\ndisk disease.  I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to\\nsee me after that.\\n\\nThanks for the referral.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nStephen Nichols, M.D.\\n\\n\\nDictated By: Stephen Nichols\\n\\n\\neScription document:6-0190274 EFFocus\\n\\n\\n\\nDD: 11/14/54\\nDT: 11/14/54\\nDV: 11/14/54\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Lynn, M.D.\\n\\nDoraville County Health Center\\n\\n897 Cider Street\\n\\nPlatteville, HI 79812 \\n\\n\\n\\nRE:  \\t\\tIsabelle Y. Quick\\n\\nATCH: \\t\\t655-75-45\\n\\n\\n\\nDear Harry and Yair:\\n\\n\\n\\nMy thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.  As you know, she is just 52 years of age.  Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.  She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.  She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.  She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.  On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.  This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.  In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.  There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.  She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.  By last spring, i.e. a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.  She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.  Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.  Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.  Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (??? length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.  Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.  She has sought an opinion here in this regard.  She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.  On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.  Pulse was 70 and regular.  Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.  She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.  There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.  She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is of course a very unhappy situation.  Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.  However I am not absolutely ruling this out.  I would suggest the following.  Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.  Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.  She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.  If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.

She\\npresented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming\\nnormal.  Her initial NI stroke scale was 11.  She was admitted to\\nthe Neurology Service for a stroke workup.  Her imaging studies\\nshowed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head\\nof the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA\\nin addition to a left ICA occlusion.  She was taken to angiogram\\nfor interventional neuroradiology.  She had an angiogram. \\nRadiology felt they were unable to access the\\ncause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was\\nadmitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and\\nhypertensive therapy.  She remained stable anti-coagulated on\\nheparin.  During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted\\nto rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to\\nbe the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to\\nremain anti-coagulated.  She was discharged to rehab and\\nsubsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.  At home, she\\nhad been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been\\nfeeling O.K.  VNA sees her once a week.  At rehab, for unclear\\nreasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the\\ndischarging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was\\ndone for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is\\nunaware of any such problems.  She continues to get PT and\\noccupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory\\nremains poor.  According to the family member and her daughter\\nwho are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues\\nto have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and\\ndecreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able\\nto communicate well with her.  Since her discharge, she has not\\nhad any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual\\nchanges.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,\\nchest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,\\nclaudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,\\nheartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,\\ndiarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,\\nrashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,\\nor bleeding problems.  Review of neurological systems as above.  \\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated\\ncholesterol.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Zoloft, Zocor, and Captopril.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in Castle Rock with her son. \\nNo history of tobacco or alcohol.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  A sister had a stroke.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was 150/80, her heart\\nrate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.  General:  Pleasant woman in\\nno acute distress.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera\\nanicteric, and oropharynx is clear.  There is no thyromegaly. \\nNeck:  Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.  Heart:  Regular rate\\nand rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:  Has good\\nbowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly. \\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Skin:  No rashes\\nor ulcers.  Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the\\ninterpreter):  She is alert and oriented.  She is attentive.  She\\nis non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.  She has\\ndecreased naming and decreased comprehension.  She does not have\\nany neglect or apraxia.  Registration is 3/4.  Short-term memory\\nis 0/4 in 5 minutes.  Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters.\\n Fundi are normal.  Extraocular movements are intact with\\nnystagmus.  Visual fields are full to confrontation.  She has a\\nright facial droop.  Facial sensation is intact.  Hearing is\\nnormal.  Motor exam:  There is increased muscle tone on the right\\narm and leg.  She has strength on the left is normal.  On the\\nright, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on the\\nleft on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.  She\\nreports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm. \\nThere is no ataxia on the left.  Gait is slow, walks with a cane,\\nand so conducts the right leg.  Her reflexes are brisker on the\\nright at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.  \\n\\nIMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any\\nacute stroke or hemorrhage.  On the CT, there was a question of a\\nleft MI cutoff.  CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA\\nstenosis with minimal distal interflow.  MRI of the brain showed\\na left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of\\nthe caudate basal ganglia.  She has had mild to moderate chronic\\nsmall vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.  Echo showed a normal\\nEF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.  \\n\\nIMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant\\nvascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\\nwith a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory\\ninfarct.  On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both\\ncomprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.  It\\nis unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her\\nstroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\\nduring her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from\\nanti-coagulation therapy.  I have asked her to get a follow up\\nPCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are\\nany contraindications to anti-coagulation.  If there are no such\\ncontraindications, she should restart on warfarin.  In addition,\\nher blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask\\nher to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d. and to maintain a\\nblood pressure diary.  \\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\n1.  Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg\\nt.i.d.\\n2.  Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.\\n3.  Continue risk factor modification with the management of\\nblood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.\\n4.  PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab\\nstay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications\\nper the PCP.\\n5.  Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait\\ntraining and language rehab.\\n6.  Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new\\nproblems.\\n\\nMore than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education\\nand counseling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nJordan Namari Akers, MD, PHD\\n\\n\\nDictated By: Jordan Namari Akers\\n\\n\\neScription document:7-1410500 VSSten Tel\\n\\n\\n\\nDD: 09/16/67\\nDT: 09/16/67\\nDV: 09/16/67\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Mr. Aguilar is a 48 yo man with h/o CF with mild pulmonary disease, who presented to an OSH on 1/26 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias, followed by a loss of left visual field, diplopia, and left sided weakness.  The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness.  The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein.  Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms, as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam.  Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis, otherwise neurologic exam non-focal.  Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles.  DDX for above includes ischemic process, though symptoms appear to be multi-focal, vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process.  Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms, or meningeal process.  We plan to obtain CNS MRI, neuro consult.  Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up.  Continue maintenance medications for CF.\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________\\n\\nDebra F. Mullen, MD\\n\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Patient was last seen in clinic in \\n\\n11-70 after which time she left for Ghana for the past six months. She \\n\\nreturned this past Friday but has since run out of insulin. She states \\n\\nthat she has been feeling well and has not had any problems but does not \\n\\nknow the amount of insulin that she has been taking. It has been \\n\\nadministered to her by a friend in Ghana. Our records show that when \\n\\nshe left Ghana she was on a 70/30 of Humulin, 20 units per day and \\n\\nalso 600mg of Rezulin and 20mg q.d. of Lipitor.\\n\\n \\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems is positive for insulin dependent \\n\\ndiabetes mellitus but other than that Ms. Xian is a fairly healthy woman. \\n\\n \\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam this evening her pulse is 80. Blood \\n\\npressure was 152/80 in her left arm. Blood sugar was 262. It should be \\n\\nnoted that she has not had any insulin since Sunday. Her weight was 116 1/2 \\n\\nwhich reflects a 1/2 lb. weight loss since 11-70. Tonight her heart had a \\n\\nregular rate and rhythm at 80. Her neck veins were flat. Her lungs were \\n\\nclear to auscultation bilaterally and there was no evidence of peripheral \\n\\nedema. \\n\\n \\n\\nASSESSMENT: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. \\n\\n \\n\\nPLAN: LFTs, A1C, basic panel this evening.

As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia.  He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint.  He has had no focal, motor, sensory deficits, and no amaurosis fugax.  A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAssessment and plan:  Overall, I am extremely pleased with Mr. Pearson's outcome given his high risk pulmonary status.  It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months' time with a repeat carotid duplex examination.  I would be happy to assist in the management of this or any of your other patients as you deem necessary in the future.  Thank you again for allowing me to assist in his care.  If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact either myself or one of my partners directly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSincerely,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSteven E.

Yamilex is a 68-year-old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2083.  \\n\\nIn 2083 Mrs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness.  She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke.  She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol.  \\n\\nMrs. Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide.  Triamterene was added.  Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure.  Of note, she was only mildly orthostatic at that time.  She also had an E. coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters.   \\n\\nMrs. Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline/phosphatase.  She had had a hemoglobin A1C of 6% tested in 2083.  \\n\\nYamilex is generally doing well.  She has no particular complaints.  She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy.  She has had no chest pains, shortness of breath, alterations in her bowel or bladder habits.  \\n\\nMedications:  Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 3.75 q.d. for her history of vertebral artery stenosis and atenolol 75 q.d.  \\n\\nPhysical examination:  Blood pressure was 170/90.  Heart rate was 82 and regular.  The HEENT examination was unremarkable.  Neck was supple without adenopathy.  There were 2+ carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits.  Chest was clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam showed an S4 gallop.  Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema.  Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2+ in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes.  Finger-nose-finger was intact, Romberg was intact, and gait was stable with a narrow base.  \\n\\nAssessment and plan: \\n\\n1.\\tHypertension.  Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled.  She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension.  I will start her on 5 mg. of Zestril in addition to her standing 75 of atenolol.  \\n\\n2.\\tNeurologic.  Mrs. Ordonez is stable status post her stroke.  She will continue on Coumadin.  I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time.  \\n\\n3.\\tPrimary care issues.  Mrs. Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2083 of 210.  I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke.  I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past.  \\n\\n\\tI have also started Mrs. Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 800 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr. Quesenberry.  I will see Mrs. Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril.\\n\\nThe patient was seen with Richard Quesenberry, M.D. \\n\\n\\n\\nMichael Goldberg, M.D.\\n\\nHH:SF:0151\\nDD:9-28-85\\nDT:10-03-85\\nDV:9-28-85\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
